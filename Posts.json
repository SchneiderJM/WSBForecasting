I updated original post as original was made rather quickly and there's been some questions. Also, do your own DD, these are just my thoughts and not advice.\n\nIntro:\n\n**\\*\\*\\* MY CHARTS KEEP GETTING DELETED..\\*\\*\\*LMK when this occurs plz**\n\nJune 2nd saw a nice jump in SP with a close outside of the Bollinger Bands on **346m** share volume.  Mean reversion is typically expected following strong closes that finish outside or near the edge of the bands.\n\nJune 3 + 4-There were **700m** shares traded on US exchange alone. **Important point:** June 3rd and 4th were sell offs with attempts to revert to the mean...Likely a fair bit of profit taking as well but shares were being dumped all day. The mean currently sits at 9.78USD (middle red line in Bollinger Bands). They didn't even come close.. the stock still sits outside of the bands \\*\\*extremely bullish signal. This is a massive game of hot potato right now as we've churned through the entire float twice since June 2 (4x if you disregard shares that aren't actively traded). That much volume occurring outside of the bands relative to the float is unbelievably bullish IMO.\n\n**Technical analysis set up:**\n\nImage 1 (below): Bollinger bands revert to mean but failed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vtm741j5k371.png?width=1970&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6591af1d86e5f80f9ab8590bf4a861b91e284d\n\n\\*\\*\\*SELL OFF HAS LIKELY FAILED\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImage 2 (below): shows an symmetrical triangle or wedge with declining volume as we move towards apex AKA volatility contraction. This occurs prior to volatility expansion (prior to a large move).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrbs3ddl5k371.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fc08d5e46b288b308fb9c3d71bff5095fa5e826\n\nImage 3 (below): image shows strong buying pressure @ 14 dollars as evidenced by multiple attempts to drive the price down that immediately bounced off that area. Last 1.5 days has been an attempt to slowly bleed it down to just above the buying pressure in hopes you'll sell them back your shares and help cover. Notice the Friday close stopped immediately above buying pressure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcqeuojw5k371.png?width=1962&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b44a910817556862abb1479becc8abd59d80b9\n\n**Price target-->** IMO could easily end up within 25-40 dollar range or higher next week based on where shorts are reapplied. Shorts were reapplied around 25 to 30 USD in January so that's probably the next stop.\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n1. Potential exists that this scenario doesn't play out on Monday and we head lower. More selling= more synthetic shares. More fake shares= more of a problem in the future for whoever is short. Just means the larger this squeeze is going to become overtime. So good for whoever's accumulating at the right price and holding on. Remember that there is great buying pressure below us!\n2. It's uncommon for trends to reverse without some sort of ranging period where shares are either accumulated or distributed. Remember, we are in an uptrend in the intermediate and long term. We have not reached distribution phase yet. Short term there may be some more pain if we continue lower but this will result in an even bigger squeeze in the long term as more shares must be fabricated so dumping can continue.\n3. At this point, BB is a better set up in comparison to AMC. AMC has done multiple stock sales to help out those that are short. Blackberry has yet to issue any shares. Also, if we do continue downward, BB is more favorable as it's a popular stock that would be purchased at this price by retail investors who are planning to hold long term. Based on warnings given by AMC management, their stock is extremely overpriced.14 USD and below begins to have nice support!!\n4. If BB management has any idea what they are doing, they'll act on this with some big news:).\n5.

We have had some pretty intense price action out there and since I posted last week, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been flooded with private messages from some of you guys wanting more information as we go along to help you understand where this market is going. Just to be clear, I am not your financial advisor and you really should invest based on your own analysis of the stock and risk tolerance. I know there is a lot of information going around out there and it can be confusing for people. Now more than ever, the use of technical tools helps us make choices not based on fear and greed, but on logic and the balance of probabilities. That being said, here is my view of the past week with AMC using volume and price as my guide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/zn6y8j95rg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2031e3bb869df44838baf462f7657da7017937)\n\nOn the weekly chart, since the breakout from the HTF (high tight flag), we have quickly reached my initial target of 63.96$. The real body of last week\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s candle is longer than the previous week\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s on slightly higher volume which is normal. It means Wyckoff\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s law of effort and result still suggests the price action is in harmony with its associated volume. For a stock to rise, it needs effort (represented here as volume). So here we have rising price action with rising volume which is good. I am a little bit concerned about the long upper wick on this candle, though, because this suggests there is quite some selling happening here. Could be a mix of price suppression, professionals taking money off the table, and some retail booking profits/panic selling. For sure, what this long upper wick tells me is that the bears have not given up yet and we are not out of the woods. The good news here is that the heavy resistance we found at 35$ got blown out of the water on very high volume. So whatever happens, we now have VERY HIGH support at 35-36$ (resistance becomes support when broken).  \n\n \n\n[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/ij4cvnvarg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=966c13ab4754a1fa66069d72fd810412c823986d)\n\nMoving on to the daily chart, candle #1 is a very important candle. I see a very long white body with rising volume which is excellent. I want to bring your attention to candle #2. When I compare these two candles, I see that candle #1 has a way bigger body than #2 but only slightly higher volume. This tells me that bears have capitulated at these levels (35$-36$) and price could move smoothly without much resistance, which is very bullish. Keep in mind that long white candles on very high volume offer a lot of support at around half the real body if a retrace would occur (around 50$). The upper wick suggests some selling was happening here, but nothing that concerns me. Candle #3 is a black spinning top and suggests indecision by market participants. It coincided with a lot of FUD being laid out there and investors were trying to digest all the information that was being poured out by the media (by the way, trading the news is a bad idea\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa just saying). I like that the lower wick is longer than the upper wick which suggests more buying than selling is happening. I believe a lot of weak hands were stopped out of their positions during this day (for the newbies out there, placing your stop loss too high will most likely result in closing your positions in highly volatile stocks as you may have experienced). The spinning top closed at 51.34$, suggesting the 50$ region acted as support here. I am not surprised of this pullback because we hit around 90 on the RSI Wednesday and a lot of traders look at this indicator to book profits. Candle #4 is an inverted hammer and suggests weakness. It acts as a bearish continuation 65% of the time, but it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s really not a candle I find very reliable. Although the current price action suggests some weakness in the last 2 trading days, the good news is that the volume is dropping significantly and thus suggests this is a short-term pullback in a major uptrend (remember Wyckoff\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s law of effort and result). We can confidently HOLD our long positions in this stock because the likeliest outcome is for the uptrend to resume soon once all the weak hands are weeded out of this stock. Some could argue that the start of a bull flag is being printed on the chart as well, which is good news once it breaks out to the upside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/pp0v8fdfrg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=35a0628428c149c40d1f0f5cf02bdc3396aeb234)\n\nOn the 30 minutes chart, candle #1 signals stopping volume with the long lower wick on the down candle at the 42$ region on above average volume. This short-term downtrend was stopped at the 40$ region with a hammer candle on high volume at #2. Shorter candle on higher volume suggests a lot of buying is happening at the 40$-42$ region and thus this is very strong support for us. Professionals were buying heavily here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[60 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/1bwtebuirg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ebb4758f22c9c1802847d44e8f08c51aa0f8c2)\n\nLastly on the 60 minutes chart, we see in the last part of Thursday and Friday a small downtrend on declining volume suggesting divergence in Wyckoff\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s law of effort and result. This downtrend is weak and will not last very long. For those who have not yet jumped on this rocket, you have another opportunity to hop in at an interesting price (currently around 48$). I still believe we are currently trading at a discount on AMC. For conservative traders, I see very strong support at 40-42$, but you could miss out on the rally if we do not retest this region. For those of you already strapped on your rocket ship seat, we HOLD THE LINE! This stock has A LOT more upside risk than downside risk at this point and we are merely in a small consolidation zone which is normal after a significant rally. Stocks do not trend in a straight line. During the whole week, I did NOT sell any of my call options even though they reached +1000% at some point. This is not the action of greed, but confidence that price action and volume support a lot more upside on this stock. Selling too soon is as bad as selling too late. I am so confident in this trade that I will be buying the dips next week to average up on my position AGAIN.\n\nTLDR: Volume and price still in harmony. Buy the dips. Strong support at 40$-42$. Short-term downtrend in a major uptrend still intact. WE HOLD THE LINE!!!!\n\nCheers,\n\nAMC 20$ 07/16C\n\nAMC 30$ 07/16C\n\nAMC 40$ 08/20C", "votes": 739, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9977, "date_posted": "2021-06-05 15:21:39", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 00:02:44", "reddit_post_id": "nsy231"}, "6": {"post_id": 14297, "author_id": 52674, "post_title": "BB$ Stock Weekend DD before Jun 7th 2021.

So the phone would be on an angle to some degree. It would be leaning against something. \n\nNow if you analyze how the phone fell youll see that that camera fell toward him. If the camera was leaning it would've fallen backwards not forwards. Unless something either pulled the bottom of the phone causing it to fall forward or something pushing the top forwards. \n\nNow if you watch the interview the phone camera that he's using is steady throughout the discussion. The table or phone doesn't wobble or seem shaky. \n\nIf you look at where he's seated he's not close to the table or under the table near the legs. Even if he was and hit the table causing it to shake the phone would've fallen backwards not forwards. Try it yourself lean your camera on a table and file yourself with the same angle. Youll see what I mean. \n\nYou can see that he talks with his hands alot in the interview with them being visible alot. But for that brief moment that that camera falls over it looks like him maybe grabbed something and pulled it causing the phone to fall forward and then grabbing it he lifted it up facing him. \n\nHe knew that he wasn't wearing pants. Anyone thats in that situation would be very conscious of not exposing himself that way but the way he picks up the camera he fully exposes himself (imo intentionally) again to send a message to us.\n\n\nHe didn't seem embarrassed or conscious about it at all. Even the way he was speaking you can kinda tell that he knew this was gunna happen. Listen to him mid sentence. He doesn't stop and be like oops sorry guys. My bad my phone fell. None of the surprise or shock factor. \n\n\nI might be over analyzing this but naturally as someone who practices law and plays poker professionally I can be very analytical. Maybe over doing it in this situation but I wanted to get others point of view. \n\nI think he had something under or around the base of his phone and he pulled the string ,cord, tie or whatever from under the table which would go up through the back thus causing it to pull the base of the phone backwards causing the phone to fall forward and expose himself. \n\n\nLmk what you guys think?\n\nThanks for hearing me out \n\n2k shares hear holdling strong \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00ac", "votes": 340, "post_title_sentiment": 0.3802, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9314, "date_posted": "2021-06-05 16:06:38", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 00:04:00", "reddit_post_id": "nsz1gy"}, "10": {"post_id": 14301, "author_id": 570201, "post_title": "High SI, Fundamentally Undervalued & An Interesting Healthcare Revolution?", "self_text": "TLDR: This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to [Ortex](https://public.ortex.com/) along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone.

This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out, the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out, meaning that the people those short shares have been lent out to have not covered given that the short share availability has done nothing but go down and sideways all of Friday.\n\nNot only does this stock have a high SI but it has increased recently, meaning a squeeze opportunity may be perfectly aligning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFundamentally Undervalued -\n\nMost high growth stocks have gotten obliterated since February 16th and this one is no different in that regard.

'Chemotherapeutic drug enhancements' is one of many of the revolutions that we could see specifically because of what this company does. Paraphrasing the CEO, 'we believe that the next big wave of innovation in Biology will derive from optical genome mapping', which is what **Bio-na-no Geno-mi-cs, $B-N-G-O**'s Saphyr does-optical genome mapping, and they do it better than anyone. According to the company itself, >500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA, FISH, and KT competition is cost effective, requires less hands on time, and has a faster turnaround time. Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives. LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works, currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these. Nor can FISH, CMA, or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can.\n\nWith this knowledge, one *wonders* why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2,500 cytogenetic labs, most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr's capabilities, but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT, postnatal screening, hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas, and solid tumor research, that is sure to change all in due time. Not to mention cost per genome reducing from $450-$550 currently to $100 by at maximum 2023 (Saphyr is already cost effective, just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome). Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system. Throw in in the nanonozzle release that 'may' include SNV detection and will 'fill in the gaps of what current NGS is missing', and one has a strong case to make that this company will revolutionize healthcare and the entire genomic sector as we know it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo What? -\n\nI hold 1623 shares and a LEAPS call option-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yh2v1k1lwg371.jpg?width=1397&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7a13df39320562ae320d8845dec8c9786cd8d2b\n\nI plan on yoloing another 10k shares in $B-N-G-O by EOY at the latest.\n\nI will not sell anything for years.

They rose capital in February at $1.50 which traditionally acts as a floor for the stock.\n\n2. Trades at 2x tangible book value compared to 12x tangible book value at cgc and acb. \n\n3. Had a nice high volume spike in February. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s very common for the big mountain rise to come roughly four months after the initial molehill rise on big volume. We\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re roughly 4 months from when the initial run up happened implying the Daddy run up could be near. \n\n4. Daily short volume remains very elevated with average daily short volume consistently around 50% although we were about 40% on Friday (which is still quite high) https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=SNDL Short interest is 13.78% as of May 14th implying shorts are shorting (selling shares they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t own) in the morning and rebuying in the afternoon in hopes of spooking others out of their shares. This implies the short interest is quite underreported. If longs can hold strong and bring higher price action towards the end of the day these shorts are going to be overwhelmed with the sp, not to mention potential margin calls as SNDL increase it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s volatility and holding requirements. \nOnce we see potentially see the automatic covering is when the party really starts \u00ad\u0192\u00c4\u00eb\n\n5. We had nice big volume up days of 622 million in May 28 and 894 million in June 3rd compared to Friday\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s down day with only 372 million shares traded. Another bullish sign that the big volume days were also very green days while the red day was on muted volume. \n\n6. Stick with equity if you can. I predict the big institutions who are buying into SNDL are selling a boatload of options and ensuring the price stays under their expiration so they can collect premiums while lowering their cost basis. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s happened the last two weeks. This can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t go on forever as the stocks price should match it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s value which imo is in the $4+ range (about 8x tangible book value) sooner rather than later. \n\n7. SNDL has only announced positive news and quality acquisitions since its peak in February with preferred debt and 19% equity stake in Indiva which owns many brands including the #2 gummy producer in the U.S. WANA Gummies. Sundial also acquired a large stake in The Valens at a deep discount compared to today\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price. Furthermore, SNDL acquired all of Inner Spirit which has the most retail cannabis stores in Canada at 80 stores. Sundial will undoubtedly replace current inventory with their own solidifying their strength as the only true vertical cannabis operator from growing, processing and extracting, to store front selling. As the industry continues to mature the margin increase Sundial will see is out of this world. Not to mention the free publicity from Reddit and Robinhood. For SNDL to consistently be a top 5 stock on Robinhood with a market cap of $2 billion is unheard of. The excitement around the stock will continue to help its real world performance. \n\n8. Sundial could very likely be acquired at any moment with 0 debt, over $1 Billion in assets including $900 million in cash. SNDL is a massive acquisition candidate at a fundamental level as it only trades at 2x book value with positive operating profit last quarter compared to CGC and acb which trade at 11x book value. \n\n9. As mentioned, Sundial had positive operating profits for the first time this quarter (primarily through passive security appreciation which shows no sign of stoping). If SNDL can continue the trend it will be picked up by more and more non weed hedge funds that require multiple quarters of positive operating profit before they can be incorporated. \n\n10. When someone buys potx or other weed etfs they automatically purchase 4.35% sundial and 5.6% of the Valens as those are the current weightings in the fund. Not to mention Indiva at a lower %. For every dollar that flows into PotX more than 10% goes to SNDL related companies. Every dollar that flows into weed funds in the future will help sundial. Imagine the money that will flow into weed companies and these funds once federal legalization is passed. \n\n11. The share count of 1.86 Billion is no more than Palantir or NIO which sit at 1.88 and 1.7 Billion shares, respectively.\n\n12. SNDL currently has 4.79% institutional ownership compared to over 15% at CGC and acb. As time goes on this will continue to rise. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s pretty normal for a developed company to have over 60%+ if not 80% institutional ownership, especially at a book value like Sundials. Book values traditionally act as a permanent floor for the stock, especially with SNDL\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s positive operating profit and expected earnings growth and sales growth of 50% in 2022. \n\n13. The meme stock craze is not close to over. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s just now being reported again on tv. Excitement is brewing and as normals continue and hear about it and get in, the avalanche should build higher than February\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s peak. Sundial differentiates itself from the other meme stocks with it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s strong balance sheet and excitement around the up and coming industry. To me, investing in Sundial here combines level head value investing with the excitement of a new industry and the loyal meme craze. \n\nHope some people found this background on the company helpful. Sundial seems to have a great runway to take off (fundamentally and technically) not to mention future catalysts like potentially breaking into the drinks market, as well as having many more medicinal and mental health uses. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s undeniable that weed is losing it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s negative stigma and is way more popular in entertainment and social settings than it has ever been. Only a matter of time before you can order it at a bar or sporting event. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s the trend of the youth and it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s just getting started.

They then take that data, organize it for free, sometimes they even upgrade the systems free of charge, and then ask for a tip for their services. This is where it gets interesting. The company then tips a very large amount to the Innovative Computer Engineer and then that engineer returns the data. Now I know what you're about to ask, but Impicklerickbytch, how can I invest?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGetting Started:\n\nThere is no formal stock exchange for these investments. These are mom and pop start up operations, most running out of their own homes because it's a tough market to break into. But as we all remember even Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos started out that way. Now if you want to get in the formal market you can get into established players such as Nestle and I hear Facebook is moving into the data collection/borrowing/retention market based on the evolving needs of their Chinese partners. But those aren't the moon shots. Getting started is easy. Simply go to any online poker site or app and begin playing. A couple of hands in just ask \"anybody h3r3 a h@cker?\". Once approached by an Innovative Computer Engineer feel free to click any link they send you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvesting and Payment:\n\nNow I've only done this once and haven't yet received payment but this is how it went down. After clicking several secured links I was able to put in my bank routing and account number along with birthday, social security number, and name of my dog and presto! As I understand it my Innovative Computer Engineer is working now to borrow and organize the data of Delta Airlines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdded bonus, environmentally friendly:\n\n I personally didn't want to get involved in dirty energy. Viktor, my Innovative Computer Engineer account manager put my mind to rest by assuring me no energy would be used in this venture.

Or a very broad TLDR at end.\n\n# The Drone (CON)\n\n1. \"Horse Fly\" is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle. Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold, right? Sure. As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your [front yard](https://youtu.be/05BaPqBXNT0?t=207) and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door? A loud drone is also a huge \"HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE\" alarm.\n   1. \"Horse Fly\" Me, the OP, being a student Pilot, I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace? Turns out they actually can, they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO. As stated on their website: **\"The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S. \"**\n      1. However, you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area (like new york) for the simple fact you don't want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day. That's a lawsuit begging to happen.\n2. The drone is limited to a 10lb payload, this even further reduces the actual amount of packagesit will be able to deliver. Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it's only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas.\n\n(1) **Tl;dr:**\n\nThe drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA, which greatly restricts their abilities considering the [majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations](http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/US%20Population%20density,%202010.png) anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone. Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention. I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human. Would be loud and attract thieves, and annoy customers.\n\n# Continued Revenue (CON)\n\n2.How will Work Horse continue to make money after i.e UPS buys all the trucks they want? Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year, which means no new revenue for Work Horse. So what about maintenance? It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems. [https://ryder.com/locations](https://ryder.com/locations). This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance.\n\n1. Drone Maintenance? I haven't found anything on their website about this, but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible? Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) **Tl;dr:**\n\nTheres **no real potential for continued revenue** after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet, workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Charging Costs (CON)\n\n[reuters.com](https://reuters.com) Did an article about workhorse charging costs. **\"Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments \".**  Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations, which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover. Not to mention EV doesn't change a god damn thing, we will create the electricity for the EV's by burning coal LOL [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ)\n\n(3) T**l;dr** Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company (like UPS). Besides, electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you're consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high (CON)\n\n\" **Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered.** \" [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html). The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in $RIDE. The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles, they have no recurring or stable revenue source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The MOASS (MAJOR PRO)\n\nThis stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes. From [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) they claim 38.5% of workhorses shares are shorted. This is massive, and literally we just caught the shorts with their [pants down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns4bqz/amc_ceo_shows_us_he_isnt_wearing_pants/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So why the fuck did you buy it then?\n\nI bought it for the squeeze.

([Original DD Link for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellurianLNG/comments/l8aspr/tellurian_tell_long_term_investment_outlook_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) After doing the math, if we have deals with similar terms such as Souki mentioned, we need one more to hit the Stage 1 benchmark. Each of the recent deals is for 3 mtpa marketing takeoff. *We have a gap of 2.5 mtpa assuming Total sticks with their agreement terms or modify's slightly as the expectation was FID by June 2021.*\n\nOne deal released a week for three weeks, leading up to the annual shareholder meeting next week. It's perfect execution on PR leading up to an all-out celebration by the leadership team. Souki can give the \u00ad\u0192\u00fb\u00f2 to the shorts, Total for selling part of their shares, and get started with construction this summer to build out the local infrastructure, FID, and then NTP (notice to proceed) in Q1 2022 with Bechtel. \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u2591\n\nI believe the next deal will be with Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) or Sinopec.\n\nKOGAS has the lion's share on their market and recent tweets about South Korea, Tell CEO being appointed to South Korea / USA business council. [https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906](https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906)\n\nSinopec recently signed their first long-term LNG contract with Qatar Petroleum for 2 mtpa. They're actively looking to secure future energy needs.  Let's do 2.5 or 3 mtpa with Tellurian and USA to have a larger contract than Qutar.  'Murica.\n\n**Driftwood Project Stages**\n\n|Stage|Plants|Capacity in mtpa|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Stage 1|Plants 1 & 2|11.0|\n|Stage 2|Plant 3|5.5|\n|Stage 3|Plant 4|5.5|\n|Stage 4|Plant 5|5.5|\n|Total||27.6|\n\nSNK\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s comment brings a great perspective on takeoff with Souki\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s comments on mtpa being greater than Stage 1 alone. The overflow would start conversations about Stage 2. Construction of plants 1, 2, 3  could begin together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Project Capacity|Percent of Assets|mtpa|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Original - Tellurian|40%|12|\n|Original - Equity Partners|60%|15.6|\n|Likely - Tellurian|58%|16|\n|Likely - Equity Partners|42%|11.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Partnerships|Contract Type|Capacity in mtpa|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total|Equity partner|1|\n|Total|Marketing|1.5|\n|Gunvor|Marketing|3|\n|Vitol|Marketing|3|\n|Total as of 6/4||8.5|\n|Required for Stage 1||\\-11|\n|Remaining as of 6/4||\\-2.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOperating Costs on FOB (free on board) forecasts were mentioned around $3.50 to the water if I recall, which could be based on the project financing provided upfront through equity partners. Since the majority of the deals are from the marketing offtake, I assume the financing for Stage 1 will need to be secured by Tellurian via loans or infrastructure programs. This self-financing could put operating costs near $4.50 mark.\n\nProject finance could be sourced by having a foundation of long-term take contracts with investment-grade partners. They list the credit rating of parties. With the recent infrastructure bill and the government's attempts at direct access to the bond market, I wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be surprised if bond issuance or infrastructure funds was part of the equation. Project partners such as GE or Bechtel could step up in agreements to provide sourcing. The majority would be bank debt. I hope stock issuance isn't the route taken.\n\nDriftwood Stage 1 EPC contract costs $700 per ton. Lifted to $710 to adjust for market changes in 2019. I believe 1-2% lift is an understatement with current supply cost changes. I've seen a 5% rise in labor costs alone in 2020/2021 in my industry. Short term I would push closer to the 14% rise. That would be $98. This rise might not last the entire duration of phase 1 construction. I'll guesstimate $45. $745 per ton.\n\n|Operating Costs|$/mmBtu|\n|:-|:-|\n|Drilling & completion|$0.88|\n|Operating|$0.36|\n|Gathering, processing & transportation|$0.79|\n|Contingency|$0.22|\n|Liquefaction|$0.75|\n|Debt|$1.50|\n|Total FOB|$4.50|\n\n**Price Targets**\n\n$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.\n\n2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34\n\n2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22\n\n2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).\n\n2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.\n\nFuture: 40% capacity equals $70 a share\n\nFuture: 100% capacity equals $120 a share\n\nMax would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245.

That's Ken  Hicks doing what he said he'd do this year - pay down debt.  $ASO has \\~$700M LTD (compared to DKS at \\~$400M).    The nice thing here - there's HUGE free cash flow, so they can buy   back shares, pay down debt, and still meet aggressive EPS goals. This  increased issuer-credit rating from B to B+.\n2.

Some say  that selling has likely been what has been suppressing the price after  surges in value. Sales are expected to decrease next year, which would   bring the multiple up or the stock down is the only mid term negative I  see.  A press release last week showed total KKR ownership below 40%.   They last sold 14 million shares on 5/5.\n2. Some  say $ASO may no longer be a comparative slam dunk - alot has changed  the past few months... e.g. all are in the 10 P/E range now, and $ASO's  significant LT debt gap won't get fixed overnight.\n\n[my previous post on why I think this is going to rocket](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrrs6c/aso_academy_sports_and_outdoors_er/)\n\nNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\n\nPlease feel free to poke holes in any of these cases", "votes": 24, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.917, "date_posted": "2021-06-05 16:49:47", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 00:05:49", "reddit_post_id": "nszyty"}, "34": {"post_id": 14325, "author_id": 467593, "post_title": "Cum rights, and how they can be very useful", "self_text": "For those unaware, [Cum rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cumrights.asp) (or \"with\" rights) allow a shareholder of record to subscribe to a rights offering declared by a company.

This report is purely for entertainment purposes and should not be considered investment advice. Do your own research and due diligence.**\n\nHello again, everyone.\n\nAfter my [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/nhhov7/cruise_ship_stocks_fundamental_comps_analysis/) of cruise ship stocks, it was refreshing to pour through companies with such strong financials. However, with healthy income statements and balance sheets come high, perhaps overly optimistic valuations. I expected that the stock price of most of these companies would be completely divorced from their near-future expected financials, and I was mostly correct, but there are still a couple of buying opportunities I am excited to share.\n\nAfter analyzing a list of some of the strongest e-commerce players in the world, I found 2 companies where I believed there is a value opportunity: Alibaba and eBay.\n\nI had expected any Alibaba buying opportunity to have been completely swallowed given that every analysis, comment, and post I see about the stock is centered around how now is a great time to buy and how many institutions are buying, but the stock is still at a level where I would consider buying.\n\nThe opportunity which suits me and my portfolio better, and the one which I have provided some additional DD on is, eBay. I won't spoil too much, but I was really excited to dive into this company, and everything I found made me lean more into buying. I was able to discover what I consider to be compelling evidence that the company is undervalued, why the stock is undervalued, and reason to believe that the price will rise to fair value in the near-term. I made a purchase of eBay stock after my research, and I do not own any of the other companies listed. I purchased the stock at the beginning of the week, and it has had a fortunate run-up since then, but the difference between the price today and my fair value estimate, $65 -> $71 does not hit as hard as $60 ->71.\n\nA quick note on my DD. I don't often put this sort of research down on paper, so this is halfway (at most) between a competent report and stream-of-consciousness research. If I wanted to look into something, I went and did it, then took down the notes and worried about formatting almost not at all. If anything is unclear, spelled wrong, or doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll go edit. I did some editing of course, but I might've missed something!\n\n**Model**\n\n[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kNprSoMUKCrM3tVNAaXkKmih45SGD7LuQdM2y2SieY/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kNprSoMUKCrM3tVNAaXkKmih45SGD7LuQdM2y2SieY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**My Due Diligence on eBay**\n\n[**https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Methodology**:\n\n* Created a three-statement model for Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Shopify Inc., Amazon. com Inc., JD .com Inc., Sea Limited, MercadoLibre Inc., eBay Inc., and Walmart Inc.,\n* Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach\n* Spread comparable companies (the companies listeD)\n* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at fair value estimates\n\n**How to use the model**\n\n* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first\n* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each \"Financials\" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here\n* I have tried to supply useful assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs\n* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly\n* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.\n* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.\n* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them\n* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!\n\n**Other Notes:**\n\n* Some of these companies have assumptions that I have baked in which should be scrutinized. I would highly recommend against jumping straight to the DCF/val matrix and instead take some time to adjust the assumptions. You may not agree with my findings and theses (plural for thesis?) so play safe!\n* The 2 irl people I showed my work to asked me to rank the companies in order of which stocks I like the most. For me, the value-based & forward-looking rankings are 1. EBAY 2. BABA 3.AMZN 4. WMT 5. SHOP 6. JD 7. SE 8. MELI\n* JMIA was considered for the list, but the financials the company publishes are lacking in depth, and I get a little squeamish when a company has \"technologies\" in its name, so I let it go. Jumia is a very interesting company though, worth looking into if you're not afraid of some sovereign/political risk.\n* MELI appears to have a shorter payables turnover than receivables. Thumbs down.\n* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP\n* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.\n* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of \"other current assets\")\n* A thousand more things.

The selling pressure by RETAIL were so intense that the professionals were not able to stop the fall in time. Thats why we say that the market fall faster than they rise. At $37, they managed to stop the fall as it takes time to stop a fast train. Same applies to your car, if you are driving at 200km/hr , even if you apply the brake, your car will take time to stop. Isnt it\n\nWhat I found interesting with AMC chart is that we clearly see that the PROFESSIONALS put big money and tried hard to stop the fall but some retails put too much selling pressure. Professionals buying heavily, is a great signal of strength . When all these retards and weak hands are out, the bullish trend will continue and price will move higher.

This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd.

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nOverall, it has been an amazing week for investors in general and all the top growing stocks that [I shared here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) have ended in green with an average return of 11.7%. So, without further ado, let's dive into this week\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s list! \n\n **Most Discussed Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/per8x892fn371.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d457b0954852cb8d3abacf10341d7dadd99e3d3\n\nBoth AMC and BB individually generated more discussion than the other 8 put together! This can be attributed to the possibility of the next squeeze and also the rallying stock price. Weed stocks also made a double entry into the top 10 list with SNDL coming in 4th and TLRY 5th (we will discuss why in the next section). Investors were most bullish about Tilray and Nokia\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s prospects as reflected by the sentiment! Another interesting observation is that it has been a rough week for Tesla with it being the only stock in the list that ended in the red.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ov3zes4cfn371.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5d580ccfea58c5659a40b50afec8b78da53666\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Almost all the stocks increased in chatter due to the rally of meme stocks and not due to any fundamental news\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. BlackBerry was also present in the [last week\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) and the stock has been running up almost 80% in the last six weeks. The discussions were predominantly driven around whether BB would be the next short squeeze play. Even though the company has made some significant strides over the last year (Collaboration with AWS being an example), there are no specific news that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s driving the current rally.\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** There isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t any new fundamental news out of the company for the current rally but the discussion exploded in Reddit and the stock gained as much as 20% on Thursday. The stock experienced a quadrupling of the average daily volume as Reddit investors piled on to the stock. The company is still trading at a healthy 17.6% increase over last week\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s closing price.\n\n**Workhorse Group($WKHS):** Even though the company did not have a good month in May with them disappointing the investors with their first-quarter results (the company only delivered six electric cargo trucks). But the shares of the company have rocketed more than 40% in June. The discussion volume as well as the trading volume has been on a consistent rise over the past week. \u252c\u00e1\n\n**Nokia($NOK):** Nokia\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s current rally is primarily driven by optimism over its back-to-back 5G network deployment wins with multiple telecom operators such as Net4Mobility, DITO Telecommunity Corporation, T-Mobile, and Optus. The company has also resolved a long-drawn patent licensing dispute with Daimler and has been strengthening its financials by generating strong cash flows. Investor sentiment has also been extremely bullish as we can see from the trends.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** Weed stocks are mainly moving due to a mix of fundamental news and retail trading interest. SNDL rose almost 30% this week before dropping down. The marijuana industry is consolidating and a spate of deals were announced this week. Adding to this, there has been progress in legalization efforts in the US. Tilray(TLRY) has also been on the run with the stock price increasing 12% and the chatter growing by 300% this week.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** AMC Entertainment($AMC) chatter grew by 189% (which is massive considering that the stock was already the [most discussed stock last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)) and Clover Health ($CLOV) discussions increased by 255% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list.\n\nThank you for reading! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "votes": 551, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5184, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9955, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 13:39:08", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 12:04:23", "reddit_post_id": "ntlyqy"}, "49": {"post_id": 14341, "author_id": 605483, "post_title": "House deposit money. \u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec will not settle for house on earth. \u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec must populate de moon. \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4 \u00ad\u0192\u00d6\u00ee\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u2557 \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 404, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 09:19:53", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 12:04:34", "reddit_post_id": "nthtb9"}, "50": {"post_id": 14342, "author_id": 608905, "post_title": "Regular \u00d4\u00c7\u00ffole blue collar guy all in on BB 2k shares at $14.23 average cost.

Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.\n\n**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**\n\nIndeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.\n\n* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)\n* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)\n\nThe first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.\n\n**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**\n\nNikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. \n\n[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6000 TWh, of which 10\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.\n\nIf we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.\n\nIt is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:\n\n* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.\n* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a \u252c\u00e1likely alternative to overcome this problem.\n* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.\n* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.\n\nNone of Europe\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.\n\n**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.\n\n**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS**\u252c\u00e1\\- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).\n\n**BEV Infrastructure focus**\n\nTesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.\n\n**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**\n\n If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks.\u252c\u00e1\n\nAbout hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00a3*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*\n\n*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8*\n\nIt is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. \n\n**US Congress \"Californification\" , not so fast**\n\nIn the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at \u252c\u00e1the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.\n\nPresident Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. \n\n[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions!\n\n[here my previous DD with a global overview on RNG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsbfm1/biomethane_renewable_natural_gas_why_it_deserves/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nDISCLAIMER: this is not a financial advice.

Huya is a twitch competitor in the Chinese region. They are mostly owned by Tencent and therefore have exclusive rights to stream Tencent games. Their current p/e works out to 25 and peg of 0.6. Excepted growth in earnings is around 44 percent this year and a potential merger is underway with a competitor that would give them a monopoly on the industry in China and thus market in-elasticity. They have a market cap of 3 billion dollars and have a whopping 1.5 billion in cash meaning losing over 50 percent is a near impossibly as the book value would exceed the share price. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s down 60 percent from it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s peak in a growing market and i thought I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6d share it with you.\n\n\nSecond one is General Motors. This may seem like an interesting one as General Motors is thought of a slow growing automotive company but gm currently trades at a p/e of around 10. With almost 20 billion dollars on its balance sheet. More importantly the company is on the forefront of the automotive industry. They have a controlling stake in an autonomous driving company called cruise which is now valued at 30 billion dollars or half their market cap. They have the second best battery technology on the market and they have a profitable electric car business and expect to invest 20 billion dollars into electric cars in the next couple of years. They produce battery powertrains that are extremely efficient and are the second cheapest to make and are selling it to third party companies. Overall they are on the forefront of multiple industries and are turning into more of a technology company whose future profits could very well be driven by strong software profits instead of hardware\n\n\nThird one is Corsair. Corsair gaming currently trades at a p/e of around 20. Last year it had revenue growth of 75 percent and its forward pe now works out to a 15, which is extremely low for the growth of the company. As streaming picks up so has the demand for the companies products do as well they own Elgato (the biggest streaming equipment brand on earth), they also own origin pc, and are extremely good value because they can secure deals directly from Corsair giving them advantage in the sector. Overall Corsair has high growth,low pe, and an exceptional outlook.\n\nFourth and final one is baozun. Baozun does e-commerce distribution and management for overseas companies coming into the Chinese e-commerce market. E-commerce in China is a rapidly growing industry not expected to slow down at all in coming years and as China continues to open up it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s economy by reducing regulations on foreign brands, we should see baozun capitalise on such. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s p/e is a bit higher then the rest at 35 but it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s expected growth of 33 percent puts that down to 27. It has a good balance sheet with 400 million in cash and also has a shopify like business for small businesses in China.

Just my personal views. \n\nCLNE peeped over $9 on Thursday and tested $11 on Friday. While the stock faded intraday it is important for all shareholders to remember why they own this name and to keep an eye on the long term. Some may be tempted to sell into the pop. Some might not trust the Reddit Apes. But trying to trade any short term movement I feel is missing the forest for the trees. The long term potential for CLNE remains huge. \n\nRemember what CLNE has built. It is the undisputed leader in RNG fuelling infrastructure. It runs an integrated upstream + downstream RNG platform that has taken years to build and is hard for others to replicate at this point. It has an enviable roster of fleet customers all of whom see CLNE as a partner of choice. \n\nLets start with CLNEs formidable downstream business. CLNE has built 550 strategically located fueling stations which support big trucking fleets, all of whom are nowadays committed to reducing their carbon footprint. CLNEs big customers like AMZN are dependent on CLNEs infrastructure to deliver RNG where and when they need it. So they are happy to lock themselves into long term offtake agreements which guarantee their fleets reliable RNG supply. \n\nCLNE wins because the offtake agreements = predictable demand. And predictable demand in turn supports the lucrative upstream business. With clear sight of the RNG demand from its long term partners, CLNE can underwrite big capex investments in methane capture + RNG conversion projects. Without this secured demand these capex projects would be much riskier to undertake. But with the RNG demand already effectively secured CLNE has derisked its investment in its growing RNG production footprint. \n\nThe big integrated oil majors get this. BP Total Chevron have all partnered with CLNE because they do not have the expertise or the downstream infrastructure to go it alone. They see no reason to replicate CLNEs fueling station network or compete for partnerships from the likes of AMZN so instead they have partnered on the upstream side of things. CLNE had to share upstream economics on new projects, but they get significant $ in return to accelerate their business towards RNG self-sufficiency. Very soon 100% of the RNG sold by CLNE at its fuelling stations will be \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3home made\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 RNG with superior economics vs CNG or RNG purchased from 3rd parties. \n\nRemember all of this if and when CLNE resumes its ascent. You do not own this stock for a short term pop. You own it because the company has a head start in an exciting renewables space that may seem niche today (relative to solar or wind) but is well positioned to play an important role in the inevitable energy transition our societies need to embrace. \n\nLong live Cow Farts.

The CPI data will show how much inflation has increased since April. When CPI data is higher than expected expect a huge sell off due to inflation FUD.

Unless the CPI data gets out of hand I personally don't believe we will see any tapering soon and guess what the most frequently asked question to Powell is? When does the FED start tapering? And everytime he gives the same answer and everytime the market sells off because of that. \n\nIt would be interesting to see what all the meme stocks will do during this period of fud since especially the majority AMC is owned by us retail investors.

All have over 100 institutions selling short)\n\nMore Catalysts:\n\n* Short selling rule active this Monday (6/7); this rule implies you cannot short a stock on an uptick if said stock lost 10% from the previous trading close. WKHS closed down 11% on Friday\n* If you look at the option data I have provided, I have monitored the open interest on WKHS the previous 5 trading days (highlighted in blue); OI -1 = 1 Day previous; OI -2 = 2 Days Previous\n* As you see circled in yellow, there is extremely bullish movement at the 15 and 20 Call Strike prices; Factoring in the flow of capital into the 15 Call around 1 million, nearing 1/1000 of WKHS \\~1 Billion Market Cap; therefore quite significant, given these are derivatives with zero intrinsic value\n* Look at the chart I have included (in a 1 day chart time period) we can note the upward momentum with the MACD shifting, and TTM trend fully engaged from the first baby squeeze to 18 two days prior, volume dramatically increasing (highlighted in green) as well\n\nA little Math:\n\n* As you can see, given WKHS is small cap stock currently, like how GME and AMC began after being shorted to the dirt, with WKHS having only a \\~1 Billion cap, there is potential to double, triple, 5x this current share price of ($13/share). Given that half of the available shares are short (\\~600 million in equity), we only need roughly 200-300 million in buying pressure for a squeeze to begin. And given the fact that there are naked shorts at the 15 and 20 Call, that 200-300 million in buying pressure would bring us to that range alone, causing shorts to start covering immediately and thus a squeeze ensuing.\n\nOption Chain Analysis:\n\n* If you look at the screenshot I have provided, you can see that the volume on this previous Friday of the options with strike prices of 15 and 20 at dates (6/11 and 6/18) are greater than the actual open interest. For those of you who don't know, open interest is the current amount of contracts that are open and effectively being sold short (Available shares x100). Since the volume of the current day is greater than the open interest this implies that the contracts were written on Friday (since open interest is always updated the following trading day)\n\nBriefing for those unfamiliar with WKHS:\n\n* A renewable, electric delivery/drone, innovative company who was in competition to receive a bid for a 6 billion dollar USPS contract to supply a large quantity of vehicles. Unfortunately, the bid was lost earlier this year and has been aggressively shorted since.\n* This is an American born, American made company.", "votes": 30, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5574, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9892, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 14:49:11", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 12:05:55", "reddit_post_id": "ntnehu"}, "60": {"post_id": 14352, "author_id": 609438, "post_title": "$WOOF - Big Brain Play", "self_text": "I think WOOF boasts very attractive upside potential with limited downside risk. If you disagree lmk why. I'm genuinely interested to know why I shouldn't have thrown half my money into this stock (I just started investing so its literally nothing - just a few grand in the Roth).\n\n**Brief Overview:**\n\n*The Financials*\n\nWOOF is Petco. It is currently trading at $22.09, market cap of 5 Billion, and an 3month avg trading volume of 2.58 million and a 10 day avg trading volume of 6.17 million. In spite of Covid-19 they did $4.43B in revenue which is a slight increase from $4.39B in 2019.  First quarter of 2021 they did $1.41B. If the keep around the same performance for the rest of the year that will lead to revenues in 2021 to be around $5.6B. The Enterprise Value/EBITDA of WOOF is 27.66. But Earnings are increasing for 2021.\n\n*The Company*\n\nThe company is making a switch from focusing on pet goods and food towards pet health and wellness. This means they are expanding to a more subscription based revenue model. They are offering deals by bundling grooming and vet-care services. They put a lot of work into their website and becoming more digital. Also they are using their brick and mortar locations as micro-distribution points. Yahoo analyst ratings are from $22-$31.\n\n**My Reasoning for Bullish Sentiment:**\n\n1. 3 Month Bullish Trend\n2. High Institutional Ownership at 55.03%\n3. Impressive Financial Success/analyst upgrades/Bullish price targets\n4. Possibility of a Short Squeeze\n5. Low Risk because the company is already being low-balled\n\nI know Short Squeeze gets thrown around a lot but Im saying it based off of the numbers. The NASDAQ releases information on the short interest on stocks 2 times a month. The last reported date was May 15th. At that point in time the Short Float was around 17 million shares (an increase from the previous report) and the days to cover was 16.1. Currently the volume is way up but the price dropped indicating a sell off. Im not too sure how to interpret this in terms of which direction the short interest is likely moving in. But in a couple of days the NASDAQ will release the latest Short Interest Data. Im mainly bullish on the company, the possibility of the squeeze is just extra.\n\nI tried to keep the post as close to facts as possible and limit my bias as best as I could. I invested in WOOF because I liked the growth potential from a Momentum/Technical Viewpoint and the Fundamentals gave me assurance in limited downside risk.\n\nMy Weakness is definitely understanding and analyzing capital structures. So any extra insight into the debt analysis and such would be helpful.\n\n\\*I got data from Yahoo finance, Google finance and Nasdaq.com", "votes": 0, "post_title_sentiment": 0.34, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9815, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 09:46:25", "date_pulled": "2021-06-06 12:05:58", "reddit_post_id": "nti6nn"}, "61": {"post_id": 14353, "author_id": 606139, "post_title": "ZIP DD", "self_text": "First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.\n \nFirst off, it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3Great Resignation of 2021\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ \n \nSo if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. \n\nThe biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.\nhttps://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/\n \nHow does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have considered.\n \nNow here\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.\n\nZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa meaning it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?\n \nI\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t getting any love (yet)\n\n1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.\n2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s dig into that\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa why did ZIP\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. \n3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t think anyone was paying attention\n4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t like that, but isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.\n \nTL/DR \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!!

However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.\n\nBut all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.\n\nThe conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.\n\nTL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6z77zsut5o371.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=588c06d2df974e5acaad7b944dce0d331d0057f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yg395out5o371.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9177fef6e1ca07bc3e7f328decc8bad34465dc91", "votes": 1230, "post_title_sentiment": -0.296, "self_text_sentiment": -0.9363, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 16:07:01", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:01:06", "reddit_post_id": "ntp2xh"}, "64": {"post_id": 14356, "author_id": 353367, "post_title": "$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 6", "self_text": " Welcome back to another episode of \"Can Virtual-Pin1025 Predict the Future?\"  \nAfter Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.\n\nWhat happened on Friday:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1\n\nThe first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.\n\nWe did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.\n\nSigns that make me bearish:  \n\\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  \n\\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  \n\\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \\~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  \n\\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  \n\\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \\~$11.30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e\n\nThese are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.\n\nSigns that make me bullish:  \n\\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  \n\\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  \n\\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f\n\n\\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  \n\\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  \n\\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  \n\\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  \n\\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  \n\\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  \n\\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  \n\\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \\~70% or Facebook with an %80.

They provide best in class cybersecurity.\n* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.\n* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.\n* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.\n* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.\n* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.\n\n# Cybersecurity Leader\n\n* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.\n* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.\n* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.\n* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.\n\n[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)\n\n# Some Basics and Fundamentals\n\n* BlackBerry has an \\~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.\n* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.\n* BB owns \\~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.\n* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...\n* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.\n* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.\n* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)\n\n# TL;DR: \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri.

It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**\n\n* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.\n* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.\n* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.\n* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.\n* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.\n\nSo, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.\n\n**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**\n\nThere seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.\n\nI don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.\n\n**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** \u00d4\u00d7\u00ed\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5 **Hold** \u00d4\u00d7\u00ed\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  **Yacht**\n\nRegardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years.

Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE\n3. Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days\n4. Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment\n\nIf you want to learn more about CLNE, I've got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out; it's an easy read. Or, recommended, you can search for one of the more in depth DD's done here; all great work.\n\n^(Disclaimers:) \n\n^(1. no images because auto-mod kept screwing me last time.  - 2.

Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words.)\n\n# Let's start with a review of analyst price targets... CLNE closed Friday at $9.31\n\n* 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE\n* Low estimate is $11.00 (18.2% gain from Friday close)\n* High estimate is $27.00 (190% gain from Friday close)\n* Median estimate is $20.00 (114.8% gain from Friday close)\n* **Cramer came out in May and said he doesn't like the stock**\n\n\"aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO\" - I know and I know. \"AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr!\" What? Ok..... **To quote Bill \\[from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last name happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker\\],** ***consider the following...***\n\n* There's a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended-term floor of somewhere near $13.49, thanks to details of their partnership with little-known company called Amazon.\n* As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc, which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations, Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of $13.49.\n* *However,* only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately. The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE. This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal, and the way CLNE runs those sales/revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment (see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near $0.00 EPS)\n* In short, Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE, but only after significant additional expenditure and investment. AKA..... *PARTNERSHIP*\n\n# Moving on to the topic of... shorts and activity...\n\nI'm not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000's pop-punk/emo music (IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM), but I think you'll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub.\n\n* Over the last 10 trading days, before Thursday/Friday, daily shares sold short sits at about 10% of volume.\n* On Thursday this rose to 26.8% on the day - on Friday again to 32% on the day\n* So what, 26 or 32% isn't huge, right? Sort of.\n* The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the **concurrent spike in volume.... In terms of absolute numbers, shares sold short went from about 500,000 per day to 8.10 million on Thursday and 10.64 million on Friday.**\n* The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone.\n* Spoiler alert.... **According to fintel, short shares availability is only 8.6 million as of June 4th.**\n* With an average daily volume of around 5 million (again, before Thursday/Friday), how many days to cover....? You do the math.\n\n# And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape...\n\nI'm not here to push any squeeze thesis, just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play (I've been in since 2020). There is short and long term potential here, in my opinion.\n\n* The \\[now famous\\] June 18th $13 strike call OI now sits at 29,544, an increase of about 25% since my last update and representing 2.95 million shares of exercisable calls. This is about 60% of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday/Friday.\n* A reddit user, who I won't name because I haven't asked them, who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat/discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest/sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company, but also believe in the product.\n* The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days, and months honestly, has been positive. The environmental side of the story is great. Besides needing a decent business case and technicals, never before in history (my opinion) has it been more important to have a good story/mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing. Our society is more social than ever.\n* **\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u00e4\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00bf\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7** \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00d6\n\nTL;DR\n\nDo I think this is a one-way ticket to \\[the planet\\] Uranus? No. Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire? No, especially because my position is relatively small. But, I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here. **The company has a product, sales, partnerships, a good story, and now the backing of an army of passionate people (read: apes) who, quite simply, like the stock.**\n\nThanks and take care.\n\n^(EDIT: not sure if reddit notes if I edited my post, but if so, I just edited to fix one extra \"s\" on a word and some formatting oddities.

This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s going on with this stock.

Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).\n\n**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month.

They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. \n\nCurrently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.\n\n[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \\(cloverhealth.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)\n\nCLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.\n\n**Positive Catalysts**\n\nAll the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m keeping an eye on: \n\n* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll pay a fine and that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s related to Medicare. \n* Biden\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.\n* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.\n* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.\n\n**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**\n\n* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s unclear when it will be settled. Although it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.\n* Hindenturd\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s constant attacks despite insisting they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s report was created to hurt all of Chamath\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)\n* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.\n\n**Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**\n\nCLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.\n\n[CLOV S\\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)\n\nNo need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be any dilution.\n\nThe P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s talk about CLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s P/S ratio for a moment. \n\nCLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.\n\nI don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.\n\nCLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s Response to Hindenburg Allegations: [https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html)", "votes": 406, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9978, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 22:59:58", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:04:11", "reddit_post_id": "nty1bd"}, "77": {"post_id": 14369, "author_id": 147818, "post_title": "What have I done?", "self_text": "", "votes": 389, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 22:59:13", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:04:22", "reddit_post_id": "nty0sf"}, "78": {"post_id": 14370, "author_id": 22389, "post_title": "Apes need Healthcare.

CLOV is starting to get a lot of attention because of the addition to the [MSCI index](https://app2.msci.com/eqb/gimi/smallcap/MSCI_May21_SCPublicList.pdf) in May, addition to the [Russell 2000](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) index in June, and the [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov) that could lead to a squeeze. I personally invested in CLOV because of the fundamentals support a $15+ share price.  I'm happy to hold on to this long-term for that reason.\n\n# Quick Fundamentals:\n\n1.

Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for \"lives under management\" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.\n\nCLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.\n\nOSH does a good job of [explaining](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4418419-oak-street-health-bar-of-expectation-may-be-set-little-too-high) how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e\n\nMA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.\n\nMedicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**\n\nBelow I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.\n\n**OSH = $14.3B market cap**\n\nOSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.\n\n* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))\n* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**\n\n**AGL = $14.3B market cap**\n\nAGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.\n\n* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))\n* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))\n* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**\n\n**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**\n\nCLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).\n\n* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))\n* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**\n\n**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**\n\nThe CEO of OSH was recently quoted \"**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated\"** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**\n\nHere are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):\n\n* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))\n* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n\nHopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.\n\n//\n\n# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:\n\n* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**  \n\n   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines\n   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature\n   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition\n* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**  \n\n   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)\n   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)\n   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR\n   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)  \n\n      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again\n      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score\n   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower\n   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code\n   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines  \n\n      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Why is CLOV Undervalued?\n\n**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**\n\n* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and \"upcoding\".\n* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about \"upcoding\". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.\n* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.\n* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**\n\n* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.\n* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.\n* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.\n* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.\n* They did state that \"[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)\".\n\n**Part 3: Differentiation**\n\n* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.\n* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.\n* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.\n* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the \"alignment\" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.\n\n//\n\n# \n\n# Risks to CLOV\n\nBelow are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:\n\n**1.** **DOJ Investigation**\n\nAs I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).\n\nAll the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.\n\nYet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for \"upcoding\" fraud cases:\n\n* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)\n* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)\n* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)\n\nThe largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for \"upcoding\". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.\n\nNo matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.\n\n**2.** **SEC Investigation**\n\nThe SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...\n\n**3. Market Multiple**\n\nValuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.\n\nThere could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Current Technical Analysis (unbiased)\n\nThere are several **bullish indicators**, however we must not discard the **bearish signals** that may bring about a short term reversal for CLOV. If a reversal does occur, at least we know that we are prepared for it, instead of being taken by surprise. But again, the bullish indicators may very well prevail. We simply **need good volume** to keep pushing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[3 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/um9bgnnmrp371.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c28ccc2e414cfe632ec9e02f27a0bed05ab4d1)\n\nOn the above chart, we see price action testing and re-testing Fibonacci key levels during the last 3 month period with successes and failures. We are now at a fork where the price may bounce off and reclaim higher levels, or breach thru and re-test lower levels. No one can pretend to know with certainty which direction will tug harder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[3 Month Cup and Handle](https://preview.redd.it/vwnw4epnrp371.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=380e0274bd5ae0f72d8a8da281d3c3308ee5302a)\n\nAbove is the 3-month period where a very clear cup and handle pattern has formed.

Price kept bouncing off the trend line to finally break out and trade sideways for several days. Another breakout occurred and we are now at the fork. A triangle pattern can be displayed, but it is unclear whether it is a bullish or a bearish pattern. Depending on how you wish to look at it, the price can break thru in any direction. Add to that the Fibonacci levels, and we have ourselves a Mexican standoff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/zi0ltovqrp371.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=b326b85e59765f7623714391c9cd2936a577c189)\n\nFinally, on the 5-day chart, if the price fails to bounce off both the 61.8% and 50% Fibonacci price zones, then we may enter a new downtrend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **In the end, volume and catalysts may keep the bullish trend alive much longer, even if minor pullbacks occur.**  \n* **We need to Hold 9$ this week in order to break through $10.50**\n* **Short sellers are underwater at 11$ so they are trying hard to prevent this**\n* **epic squeeze could happen if we break 11$**\n* **Do the shorts really not think insiders would like to see 30$ before they can sell anything?

This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.\n\n# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?  \n\nWell..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.  \n\n[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)\n\n[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)\n\nHe made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.  \n\nWith great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??\n\nyes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.\n\n[so basically, the amount of OPEN INTEREST on each STRIKE in the CALL OPTIONS CHAIN tells us how many shares market makers need to buy in order to hedge when an option goes IN THE MONEY.](https://preview.redd.it/9xwx5eusvp371.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=a249f7e92d29af0518dddff6cb7079788f1c88c8)\n\nSo basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.

RNG allows for negative emissions and is extremely cost effective.\n* Clean Energy ($CLNE) is an established RNG provider with little to no competition. They own most of the infrastructure and the only reason they're not reporting profits quarter after quarter is because they're just building more, prioritizing growth over short term profits.\n* $CLNE just secured massive deals with Amazon (heard of them?) and Chevron, paving the way for universal industry adoption.\n* The fact that the technology is so misunderstood by Wallstreet has created a tremendous opportunity for early investors.\n* PRICE : Even with some of you readers realizing the stock's potential last week, the current price (9.59$ AH) is sitting at a HUGE discount from it's intrinsic value as well as from Amazon's optional buy-in price of 13$. A large number of analysts have openly supported this by setting EOY targets ranging from 11$ (extremely conservative) to 27$ (3x).\n* Why does this matter? This means your potential downside of buying at 9.59$ is AT WORST the 15% gained from it's established support at 7.5$ while your potential upside is SIGNIFICANT. As a shareholder, I personally do not see a reason to sell this stock even if the short term scenario (detailed below) plays out because there are few other growth stocks which match it's mid-term potential. Compare this with the possible downside of other meme stocks before making a decision.\n* POTENTIAL SHORT TERM PLAY : So if you've read my previous DD as well as the DDs of fellow cow fart enthusiasts, the open interest on the June 18th 13c is a whopping 29,000 with significant open interest on the strikes before and after up to the 20c. As the price approaches 13$, the option sellers who have sold their calls naked are forced to buy shares, driving the price higher. In return, considering the stock has been heavily shorted by Citadel, Blackstone and the like in the past few weeks, this puts short sellers in a precarious situation, especially as we go above 11$. All this, combined with a low market cap (small purchase = big effect), leads to an explosive cocktail. The potential for a gamma and subsequent short squeeze is only the cherry on top for one the best growth stocks in green energy.\n\nSo in the end, we have a stock with :\n\n1. Extremely limited downside, significant upside (buy low, sell high)\n2. Long and short term gain potential\n3. Unparalleled potential for growth\n4. Little to no competition in it's field\n5.

One of these terms is \"Days-To-Cover\".\n\nDays to cover is related to the short ratio as a measure of short interest in a stock. DTC is calculated by taking the quantity of shares that are currently sold short and dividing that amount by the stock's average daily trading volume. For example, if hedge fund \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557s have shorted 2 million shares of $TENDIES, and the average volume is 1 million, then days to cover is 2.0.\n\n**So Who Cares? Why Is It So Important?**\n\nDTC can serve as a signal on how bearish or bullish traders are about a company. A high days-to-cover ratio might be a signal that company performance is shit.\n\nIt also gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557s have to buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Obviously they'll try to buy back the shares for the lowest price possible. But since they have created a higher demand for shares, this will drive up the price. Since the price is higher, they need to close out even more of their positon.... which drives the price higher, and so on.\n\nAlso, a high days-to-cover ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.\n\nTL;DR: high days-to-cover = \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557s being assholes, more likely for $TENDIES going to the moon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp#:\\~:text=Days%20to%20cover%20is%20a,stock's%20average%20daily%20trading%20volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp#:~:text=Days%20to%20cover%20is%20a,stock's%20average%20daily%20trading%20volume).", "votes": 63, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.902, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 20:23:33", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:05:36", "reddit_post_id": "ntuph4"}, "89": {"post_id": 14381, "author_id": 609755, "post_title": "How has the Reddit effect impacted cannabis stocks?", "self_text": "On Tuesday 9th February, a user who claimed to make over 500,000 USD in earnings from the famous cannabis stocks Tilray and Aphrra boosted told the forum\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s 8.8 million members that they still had a lot more room to rise. \n\n\nHis post quickly started trending and today has around 13000 upvotes and 1200 comments.\n\n\nTilray has been in the news quite a lot lately. The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r/wallstreetbets.\n\n\nSince December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%. Other companies are also riding this wave: Canopy Growth\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s shares have doubled, and so has ETFMG Alternative Harvest, a fund tracking cannabis stocks all over the world.\n\n\nSince Wednesday 10th February, Reddit Day traders have started showing a lot of interest in cannabis stocks. Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.\n\n\nOn the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.\n\n\nHedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). \n\n\nNonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. \n\n\nThe only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?\n\n\nSource : You can read more detail in [this article]", "votes": 63, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9865, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 17:20:10", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:05:37", "reddit_post_id": "ntqo6x"}, "90": {"post_id": 14382, "author_id": 609759, "post_title": "Sir, This is a $WENdys", "self_text": "Long story short a couple of retards on WSB did their DD and found that Wendys is completely undervalued due to the pandemic.

I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329\n\nLook, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. \n\nAs retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable \"risk-adjusted\" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as \"volatility\", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. \n\nWe can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. \n\nI've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.\n\n**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** \n\nBed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. \n\nUnder the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. \n\nThey also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. \n\nWell, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \\~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees (the presentation is phenomenal, and if you PM me I will email it to you). \n\nThey went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit \"reset\" on the console. And they saw that it was good. \n\nIn November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. \n\nWhile some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. \n\nAs of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: \n\n[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)\n\n**So where does this all leave us today?**\n\nThe company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).\n\nFor the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.\n\nThey have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.\n\nThey are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \\~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \\~126mm to \\~109mm.\n\nNormalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \\~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.\n\nApplying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \\~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \\~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.\n\nSince they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \\~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \\~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \\~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.\n\n**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** \n\nI can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). \n\nIn this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**\n\n[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)\n\nIt might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. \n\nEventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.\n\nWhile I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.\n\nEven with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. \n\nSo, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.", "votes": 60, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5267, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9998, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 15:08:43", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:05:40", "reddit_post_id": "ntntnv"}, "93": {"post_id": 14385, "author_id": 609775, "post_title": "NSCC-2021-002 coming into play!

(Full DD)", "self_text": "**Another healthcare company?**\n\nCLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:\n\n* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).\n* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.\n\nMedicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.\n\nCLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:\n\n* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).\n* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.\n* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.\n\nBy doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).\n\n**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**\n\nMedicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll review later). This is CLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 and other Medicare Advantage providers\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.**\u252c\u00e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9afneo9olo371.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3c332eee871f02c6e955a409c6011622d981\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.\n\nThis necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.**\u252c\u00e1The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**\n\nBeyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4j169dplo371.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44f4e56483385721f4b034c285d513246c51d20\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.\n\n* UnitedHealth Group serves \\~6.5M people.\n* Humana serves \\~4M people.\n* BCBS serves \\~2.5M people.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b89k1msqlo371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f05df9cad06d0d473366ad04eb8028470c3942\n\nFurthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvj0s8cslo371.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b011e630db50b7008e6f2006b9444e369f69362c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMedicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \\~240,000 enrollees (\\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr2ys39tlo371.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d6d1654276df35b2cc1759ff4b8c812b2797db\n\nIn general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.\n\n**Small fish, big sea**\n\nCLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s fastest growing insurers capturing \\~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6qdc7kulo371.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e474994dead07b53f86c73ddd628ea4c96e40b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.\n\nRemember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.\n\nThey\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).\n\nFurthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:\n\n* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.\n* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3unbiased and independent\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.\n* CLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s under his name to his own company.\n\n**Financials**\n\nCLOV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a one-off fluke.\n\nTheir balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.\n\n**So, do I like CLOV?**\n\nThe short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat.\u252c\u00e1\n\nThe industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3play\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.\n2. Clover Health\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.\n3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.\n4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.\n5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans.", "votes": 55, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9976, "date_posted": "2021-06-06 17:38:35", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 00:05:42", "reddit_post_id": "ntr1wb"}, "95": {"post_id": 14387, "author_id": 590676, "post_title": "\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7Tellurian $TELL, keeping the \u00ad\u0192\u00ac\u00c1Driftwood Dream alive, why you should care about \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00efLNG, and why this stock is a must have\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "Admittedly \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7TELL and Liquid Natural Gas \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00efis not as sexy as weed stonks and \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4meme stonks\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4, but that does not mean that TELLdoes not have a lot to offer.

The Driftwood Dream has been going since 2016, it would seem we are on the cusp of making that dream a reality. \nThis summer we should be seeing some press release on infrastructure build out related to the actual pipeline \u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00f9 construction \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00ba\u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u2551 .

The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state.

LNG can also be derived from landfill gas. At a landfill near Livermore, California, landfill gas converted into LNG is being used as fuel to power trash collection vehicles. The plant can produce up to 13,000 gallons of LNG per day from landfill gas, enough fuel for 300 LNG powered collection trucks across 20 California communities. This technology not only turns waste into a renewable energy source, but it also benefits the environment due to the significant reduction in fuel emissions produced by the garbage truck fleet.

Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.

Everyone has seen the \"Roast Me\" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term \"metapragmatic roasting\" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https://preview.redd.it/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)\n\nHere is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence.

Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Coincidence? ](https://preview.redd.it/zug6vms5nu371.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=2144efe81af5d11abfd7702386aa5301defef822)\n\n**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10% short which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

[https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/dow-gold-122020181](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/dow-gold-122020181)\n\nThe jist of it is that in 1918, a man has 10 ounces of gold.  For this example below, we want to look at real purchasing power, not inflation , so while 10 ounces of gold would have cost $200 in 1918, we are going to say it cost him $20,000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------ ONLY HOLDING GOLD ---------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he had held the 10 ounces of gold from 1918 until today, our original 10 ounces of gold would now be worth $20,000.  There is no gain from only holding gold.  In this scenario it is a shiny rock.  (we know that if he held cash, he would have LOST $19,800 purchasing power)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------- ONLY TRADING THE STOCKS ---------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy comparison, an equal and simple $20,000 \"buy-and-hold\" investment indexed to the Dow from 1918 to 2018, with dividend reinvested, would have yielded an annual return of 10.44%  The gain on this trade would have been $4.26 million.  The total return was 21,200%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------TRADING THE DOW GOLD RATIO ------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing $20,000 and trading the Dow/Gold ratio, we end up with $8.4 million a century later. That's a 41,000% return, or double the above investment.  (a forty one thousand percent return of real purchasing power)  I know some of you might be able to throw 100k at this - it seems like a pretty easy way to make 40 million.  Or just use 20k of your 100k to get to 8 million.  Is this BAD advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m4nky8nvr371.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a694e1ab6a10b8b619e065ee58f3156f5fa15af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we saw in the first example, just holding the shiny rock didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t provide any return, it only protected against inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, if gold or silver were merely inflation hedges, they would actually follow inflation, right?  They would follow the money supply or any other stable number.  You wouldn't have these wild swings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hnk6iyvvr371.jpg?width=1828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6b52920640c943cbd3ac04663f8353b53f781f7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother way to look at this is ff you bought gold in 1980 for $800 an ounce, and then sold it in 2000 for $300 an ounce, you would have actually LOST money.  During this time the CPI and cost of everything didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t go down, it went up.  So gold should have risen.  It would NOT have performed as an inflation hedge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis tells us that if we buy at the wrong time, we lose money.  However, if we buy at the RIGHT time, we have huge gains.  And when we combine that with buying stocks when they are cheap (not right now, although the Dow could hit 40,000 in a melt UP) we get massive gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n41,000% of REAL purchasing power gains.  Again, this is not inflation adjusted, if so it would have been a 4 million percent return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you buy gold at the right time, you actually do gain purchasing power, and more importantly, you don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t lose during most stock market corrections.  Then you buy the cheap stocks and hold them while they go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you are not on board with this, think about making 10% of your portfolio gold, silver, or computer money, whatever you think is stable and won't lose.  For gold, you only have to look at what every central bank is doing. (except Canada, lol)  Use the amazing power of the internet to see what China and Russia are doing with gold right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor silver \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 well \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 you literally have silver in your hand right now.  It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s used in electronics and solar panels.  70% of silver is used by industry, so it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s definitely not just a shiny rock.  It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s actually a critical metal that will be in short supply for the rest of our lives.  In 2100, there will actually not be any more silver in the ground to mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know about computer money.  I am not big on real estate right now\u00d4\u00c7\u00aabecause it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s in a bubble.  I think that if you have 100k and you buy silver, that will increase to 500k!  And then you can sell it for cheap stocks or then buy a house.  Again, look at the above charts.  Silver and gold have massive swings during these bubble pops and stock market corrections. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you bought a house for 100k, I think that bubble will pop and you will lose 80k \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 you will be underwater on your mortgage because it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s only worth 20k.  When this bubble pops, how many 20k houses could you have bought with the 500k of silver?  Twenty five?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis would be similar to trading the Dow/Gold ratio.  The silver/real estate ratio.  It really does look like most things are in a bubble.  This might expand before popping, or who knows, it might never pop again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy4vkbzqwr371.jpg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6cf8f1468006a106305922315c6ea56726fdc36\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ca5k82quwr371.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ca0fd3ee79a85270052e893db1bf4bbf9ec176\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4xstd8wwr371.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=99f5413d77225c62b9ee3a3046aea1427f001143", "votes": 42, "post_title_sentiment": 0.4404, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9785, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 04:46:14", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 12:05:45", "reddit_post_id": "nu45rg"}, "116": {"post_id": 14408, "author_id": 602082, "post_title": "ACADEMY & THOR Tues Earnings", "self_text": "Thoughts on the earnings call on Tuesday for Tho and ASO.

The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years from $12B in 2020 to approximately $16B in 2025.\n\nFIGS sells 98% of their products through their digital platform, and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of healthcare professionals at scale. They also have an Ambassador Program ([Awesome Humans](https://www.wearfigs.com/pages/awesome-humans)), consisting of over 250 healthcare professionals from around the world, which further drives engagement with the community. In addition to the Ambassador Program, FIGS inspires customer loyalty by building authentic relationships.

The high profitability of mining thiscaused a surge in demand for hard discs.\n\nHowever, Chia mining is largely popular in Central and SE Asia right now, with some movement in the West. I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's. \n\nThis initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices. With Western digital share price being $52 at the start of the year and now around $77/78. Seagate is also up from $60 to $99. \n\nHoffman, the president of Chia Network, says he 'is suprised at the speed at which the hard disc capacity devoted to Chia has grown and admits that this is likely to caused disruptions to the supply chain for some time.'.\n\nIn summary, Chia is more profitable and more energy efficient than GPU mining.

There are hedge funds that run quant strategies which buy and sell stocks based on momentum alone and would have possibly made a ton of money on the AMC stock price run-up. So the whole narrative that you are going to stick it to \"Hedge funds\" or \"Wall Street\" is just plain wrong.\n\nAnother thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.  Don't believe me, go check it out here for yourself. You believe you are doing well saving a dying company, but you are just helping company insiders become rich.\n\nPlease always do your own DD, and please apply some common sense, it would go a long way in saving, and eventually making some money.\n\nEdit: Link to stock sales: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc/insider-activity)", "votes": 0, "post_title_sentiment": -0.2057, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9783, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 11:55:32", "date_pulled": "2021-06-07 12:06:06", "reddit_post_id": "nuakrv"}, "130": {"post_id": 14422, "author_id": 72986, "post_title": "NOT EVERY STOCK IS A SHORT SQUEEZE", "self_text": "Honestly lately every post I see is a \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3*RandomTicker* short squeeze buy now\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 You apes need to understand that having a 30% short interest doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t mean the stock is going to squeeze.

I am going to ride the wave up and get out and die in the void of fucking space. Be sure to sell when the profits meet your expectation and do not gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. \n\n**Derp:**\n\nWe are at a critical point for AMC; either we make it or don't. I have the utmost faith in the community and in all the shareholders that we are going to be able to hold and not succumb to the pressures of major financial entities. I, for one, will not be selling. I have waited 6 months and invested thousands of dollars into an idea and cause that I believe. It is a total success or complete failure for me. I am not saying that it needs to be that way for you, but we can only win this together. I have been reading a lot of varying opinions on the future of AMC stock. From a technical standpoint, we have reached the top. However, if we can develop a strong uptrend, we can win. I just wanna be that guy getting his knob slobbed in the handicap stall in a Wendy's bathroom for once in my miserable cuck life. \n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nWe are at a major determining point for AMC First, let's look at the Daily (left side): We hit an RSI of around 96 the second time and are highly oversold. The first time it markets a temporary Top! Normally a stock moves in Waves. We detached from the MAs and are likely to return to the 50 EMA earlier or later. Volume Analyses also show signs of excessive bullish volume we normally see on overshooting tops.\n\nLet's look at a shorter time frame now (4h - right side): We see a weakening RSI. The Trend has not broken down so far, and the 9 ema is still holding. I suggest at least set a stop or Trailing stop below here. The VolumeAnalyses is showing sell signs (red triangle down) In case of a pullback, the first \"Volume support\" is around 15, marking the top of the prior re-accumulation phase. A backtest of the \"last point of support\" is normally needed to confirm the bias and regain strength for the next move. The bullish scenario would be a pullback on low volume that is holding the support zones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t85fpxe1v371.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59a164662824320b320b07ac270a981b69b6b06d\n\nHowever, Exploring Gann fans. AMC has been respecting the 1:2 and trading in that channel. If the Current low respects the 1:1 trend line, then there's room for a move from 45 to 216 in one day. Not that it will, but that's the \"reasonable\" limit. If it significantly breaks the 1:1, well, then the fun's over, I suppose.\n\nNote: Gann Fan is built using the lows from the 24th and 27th; the connection to the close on Friday is a coincidence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hekabzbf1v371.jpg?width=1463&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81aefb093ee6ffc29d05e34a690d057f0341783f", "votes": 298, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9889, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 15:19:00", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:05:38", "reddit_post_id": "nuf2db"}, "161": {"post_id": 14453, "author_id": 57089, "post_title": "12k in BB Calls checking in.

But first let's touch base on the fact that BlackBerry and Amazon are no stranger to partnerships between the each other. In fact BlackBerry collaborated with Amazon all the way back in 2015 when Amazon integrated it's App store into BB10 devices which were run on QNX.\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nSo what is BlackBerry IVY? It is a multi-year agreement with Amazon Web Services(AWS). We can look at it as cloud platform for automotive industry to have vehicles exchanging information with one another as well as the passenger, automotive manufacturers, operators and even the grid of a smart connected city. \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nLet's start with the advantages of being connected to the manufacturer. We have already seen this in other EV's and unsecured technologically advanced vehicle platforms. This ability can help the manufacturer identify problems over the air and rectify them with secure updates or even issuing a message to the driver about the need to have something brought in to be looked at. For example a vehicle recall, battery replacement/upgrade, tire monitoring systems and more. \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nNow being connected to the passenger allows the system to deliver unique interactive cockpit experiences designed by the automotive brand and developers all while your vehicle drives you to work or even taxis others around while you're at work. It does this using vehicle data sensors and analytics to customize the users experience. \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nEnabling fleet operators with BlackBerry IVY unlocks the potential for massive improvements in logistics and asset tracking, BlackBerry already sells asset tracking devices for fleet operators (BlackBerry Radar) and is currently collecting and improving efficiencies for any operators utilizing it's system with data analytics and sensors.\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nIf the system is connected to the grid, this unlocks a massive opportunity to increase city and traffic efficiencies. Ever get stuck at a red light with no traffic coming in any direction? Now imagine lights turning green for a single vehicle or monitoring traffic and allowing heavier traffic to be given precedence at a intersection.\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nV2V (vehicle to vehicle) communication will allow cars ahead of you to mark pot holes or warn other vehicles of the dangers ahead. Not only this but in autonomy V2V communication can allow possibilities like convoying with vehicles and drafting off each other bumper to bumper on a congested highway. What if the car in front of you stops? Each vehicle will know what will be happening with the vehicle in front of you, it will know anytime the other vehicles change speeds or engages the brakes. This could allow vehicles to travel safely and more fluently.\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nTL;DR Basically IVY will improve efficiencies in a smart city, for operators, manufacturers and also increase personal productivity. It will do this by allowing you to get things done in your car and spending less time on the road and in traffic. It will enable this while maintaining the freedom and ability to operate the vehicle yourself. If you work 9-5 or have a road trip you can sit back be entertained, relax and eventually even sleep while your vehicle takes you places. They already have a patent for autonomous refueling which highlights the ability to be able to go anywhere and not get distracted by your travels. \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\n[YouTube | BlackBerry IVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDnUNENSoY)", "votes": 393, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9981, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 00:56:46", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:05:41", "reddit_post_id": "nusexx"}, "164": {"post_id": 14456, "author_id": 585879, "post_title": "Go #CLOV Don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t miss the rocket to the MOON.", "self_text": "", "votes": 281, "post_title_sentiment": -0.1531, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 21:49:03", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:05:42", "reddit_post_id": "nuole1"}, "165": {"post_id": 14457, "author_id": 383640, "post_title": "EMERGENCY DD", "self_text": "Fellow retards,\n\nI need you all to focus for just a few minutes please.

Married options do exist and they are often used to \"adjust\" a hedge funds overall position/leverage so they don't get a call from marge; but this still gives us some insight even if its not the whole picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/wrt1vtd9ov371.jpg?width=1629&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6aaf8615988616b83aab71fc45339ecbb80bef61)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Susquehanna CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/c0jdq1xiuv371.jpg?width=1633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2442b37ec43df11f9ea84f8c944d17a780ce2a83)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Susquehanna CLNE](https://preview.redd.it/7npjdcznlw371.jpg?width=1628&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=484b350c7997713313917631d7d79e8e49460e2e)\n\n[Citadel UWMC](https://preview.redd.it/y8yziuu5vv371.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c892a8a6764378d1c8fc0ca8a328dfd8d7578eec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel BNGO](https://preview.redd.it/netbwz4puv371.jpg?width=1636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=141b0175c080fe8dc1f5ebd628a5a5a888d2563a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel ASO](https://preview.redd.it/80tlvodzuv371.jpg?width=1682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3fd4cec5cd2918ede53666f737d46561a6e2c43)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Susquehanna BB](https://preview.redd.it/0i93hdbcvv371.jpg?width=1646&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cff3cdd2d985c85d6db0df791a5eba45def54dcf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel TLRY](https://preview.redd.it/djwyn53evv371.jpg?width=1626&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63a8b47b8cb8fc604a49b892fecabfa7a72b9f5d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel ATOM](https://preview.redd.it/k64ekfdivv371.jpg?width=1677&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b768109c5a2efbcaff6d9d3fbddd05abfbb3a66e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel VXRT](https://preview.redd.it/62y50z0svv371.jpg?width=1628&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ef6cf65cd36e6e889cc1860d3c4ec83c509bf51)\n\n[Citadel GME](https://preview.redd.it/et5yz84kvv371.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef19cc50a79fa3e8597dc5c58e08a1dbccfd31cf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Susquehanna GME](https://preview.redd.it/x4ci96olvv371.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd6ec20b56910ba86906d1f205d2011e3cd96cdc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel AMC ](https://preview.redd.it/jblc90invv371.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61168ecbb8924992eb281243ee912292e368b29c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Susquehanna MVIS ](https://preview.redd.it/r48cvr96xv371.jpg?width=1661&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84e3a74993a6c9de2bd98b683de0da67d7f4c356)\n\nThis is only a glimpse of what this sub has been infiltrated with.

There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.\n\nIf BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. \n\nMy guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more. \n\nTL:DR; Buy BB or not. I'm not a financial advisor.

THIS POINT IS NOW WRONG. It is 100 million dollars worth of shares which is way less concerning to me. \n\n3. CLNE is still undervalued and MASSIVELY so. Fair value of CLNE in its current state is $24 a share. That\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s without gamma squeeze stuff, without momentum stuff, just pure intrinsic value of the company.\n\n4.

Clover Healthcare (CLOV) and Danimer Scientific (DNMR) both flashed buy signals in the past few days. Both companies are the target of Short Seller attacks and law firms soliciting customers to join shareholder lawsuits. The good news is that both CLOV and DNMR are rebounding, and I think this is just the beginning. Both are well off their 52 week highs, and both have a long way to run.\n\nOne of the simplest methods for new investors to answer the question of when to buy is to watch the Simple Moving Averages (SMA). When the 5 Day Moving Average crosses the 30 Day Moving Average going up, it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a buy signal. \n\nUsing this method, AMC gave a buy signal on May 13th, when the stock closed at $12.98. We all know what happened after that.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6p6b9786ow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf9859bdf9aae55e8c9789b566e21e2231460f85\n\nThis method isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t foolproof. It will give some false buy and sell signals, and by definition you won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t catch the high or the low, but it will catch major up and down trends.   \n\n\n**$CLOV gave a buy signal on June 3rd, when the stock closed at $8.90**  \nCLOV also gave a false buy and sell in May, essentially selling it and buying it back at the same price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y4x7t5cow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7350ae99bd09b9121e359dd44801208114c36cbd\n\n**$DNMR gave a buy signal on Jun 1st, when the stock closed at $21.88.**  \nFollowing this signal with DNMR, you would have had a false sell and buy signal in Feb and Mar, but you would have sold it at $37.90 on 3/25, preventing a long, painful ride down before it bottomed out at $15.38. Selling it at $37.90 and buying it back at $21.88 would also let you buy back more shares. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n75xpi6kow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae3f68eb5c966cf9fe8a9526d7d1b4fc64409a\n\nEven with the occasional head fakes, this signal catches the long term trends up and down. I think it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s another useful datapoint to double-check your investment decisions.  \n \n\n**Support and Resistance**  \n As another datapoint, both CLOV and DNMR are above most of their moving averages. CLOV is above its 30, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. DNMR is above its 30, 50 and 200 day moving averages, but still below its 100 day moving average.  \n \n\n**CLOV**  \n 30 Day SMA: 8.30  \n 50 Day SMA: 8.19  \n 100 Day SMA: 9.61  \n 200 Day SMA: 10.55  \n \n\n**DNMR**  \n 30 Day SMA: 21.61  \n 50 Day SMA: 26.06  \n 100 Day SMA: 34.60  \n 200 Day SMA: 23.90  \n \n\n**Fundamentals are Strong**  \nBoth $CLOV and $DNMR have fundamentally strong businesses in the early growth stage. Clover is a small, growing healthcare company with proprietary software. Danimer Scientific makes biodegradable plastic resin, and is aiming to address the single use plastic waste crisis. I believe both companies have bright futures, with sales and earnings expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.  \n \n\n**Short Interest**  \nThis isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t the reason to buy, but it may be icing on the cake. According to Marketwatch, CLOV has 35.8% of the float shorted, well above GME (21%), AMC (18.93%) and BB (9.0%). DNMR has 15.8% of its float shorted.

Usually I'd imagine this would be a longer timeline (weeks, months) but if there is any kind of short squeezing obviously things can happen fast like we saw today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zu5fapo4sw371.png?width=1821&format=png&auto=webp&s=4683fe0074cf9fa8f97cbedcb8eb63c07e917065\n\n* On the 10min chart below it beautifully rode up the 5-12 EMA cloud with a little sideways action between $11.00 and $11.30 before it broke through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Pretty great closing volume on the day and it seems to be running after hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lii49qh5sw371.png?width=1821&format=png&auto=webp&s=78b89e8d16eaf4165ba40f24fd92dd0e361fe061\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Remember, I don't know what I'm talking about and your decisions are your own!", "votes": 183, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9655, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 21:11:58", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:05:56", "reddit_post_id": "nunqgr"}, "179": {"post_id": 14471, "author_id": 611031, "post_title": "CLOV to the moon \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00d8", "self_text": "", "votes": 192, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 23:50:28", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:05:57", "reddit_post_id": "nur5dx"}, "180": {"post_id": 14472, "author_id": 611034, "post_title": "30k shares of $WKHS and holding, a little scared but going to be super patient with this one.

This, though not optimal, is how they choose to fund infrastructure projects.\n\n^(None of this is financial advice, and you should review these filings yourself and develop your own opinions.)\n\n# So, ya boy, CLNE, filed a form 8K with the SEC today. \"They're diluting the stock and all of our livelihoods are about to go down the drain.\" Not quite...\n\nI'm sorry it took me an hour to get to typing this - reading 8k's takes way too much time. If you've been following CLNE since before this traffic picked up, then you're already well aware of what you're about to read. However, since a lot of you are new to this company I'll write out why they do this, what their goals are, and what it means for the stonk.\n\nTodays filing is something that CLNE has done in the past. We can use the most recent A.T.M. (at the money, not ass to mouth sorry) offering as an example:\n\n* May 10th - CLNE announces A.T.M. offering, capped at $100 million, purpose to fund infrastructure projects\n* Between now and then - shares are sold, money is made, funding infrastructure projects\n* June 7th (today) - The offering is complete, $99,999,976 is generated, the offering is closed\n\nIn today's 8K filing, the closure of that offering above was reported. In the same 8K they opened up a new A.T.M. offering that is **(spoiler alert) going to look exactly like the one above**\n\n* June 7th - CLNE announces A.T.M. offering, capped at $100 million, purpose to fund infrastructure projects\n* Between now and when it closes - shares are sold, money is made, projects funded\n* Closing day in the future - The offering is complete, about $100 million is generated, the offering is closed\n\nDo you sense a pattern here? Maybe you do have a wrinkle after all... This method of operating, though I don't necessarily agree with it, is a stable and quick way to generate capital to fund a rapidly expanding infrastructure system. They're building stations (565 last time I checked). They're expanding their footprint and capabilities. They're building capture facilities to increase raw material for production. They're **laying pipe** (heyyyyy there).\n\nThe day will come when CLNE will fund 100% of their projects and expansion with revenue, and with their market emerging and being so well positioned, I don't think that day is far off. With partnerships from the likes of Total, Chevron, BP, Amazon, UPS, and others they clearly have sales and revenue downstream. The best way to reach them all is to expand, and (at least for right now, in the eyes of the company) the best way to expand is these small offerings.\n\nI'll link the 8K in the comments.\n\nDo your own DD, see you on the moon.\n\nCheers.", "votes": 149, "post_title_sentiment": -0.1542, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9906, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 21:41:59", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:06:02", "reddit_post_id": "nuofix"}, "185": {"post_id": 14477, "author_id": 18172, "post_title": "Look Out, CLNE Is Coming Through.", "self_text": "", "votes": 179, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 00:16:21", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:06:03", "reddit_post_id": "nurndr"}, "186": {"post_id": 14478, "author_id": 31078, "post_title": "Get your lucky CLOVers.

Apparently he does not think trucks will be using natgas and thinks EV is the only way to go. \n\nNewsflash Cramer: big trucking fleets and municipal fleets have already adopted natgas. In a big way. Specifically they are embracing RNG because it is the cleanest fuel out there with a negative carbon footprint. Nobody is going to use natgas? Why dont you tell that to UPS and AMZN. AMZN has agreed to buy up to $500mm in RNG and that is excluding certain transfer costs so the total revenue opportunity is closer to $800mm according to credit suisse. These big customers have already invested millions in RNG engines and they did not do so because they thought \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3hey wouldnt it be fun to run our trucks on cow farts.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8\n\nBottom line: There are lots of naysayers out there who pretend like they know everything. Yes Cow farts are easy to dismiss. And CLNE is a relatively undercovered name. And yes Wall street analysts find it easy to spread misinformation on CLNE via controversial research in order to make a name for themselves. And yes RNG is a niche area today vs wind and solar. BUT the big fleets are bringing this fuel into the mainstream and that is the real story. Those that are poo pooing RNG are dismissing something they do not quite understand yet. You and i will never run our cars on RNG because the refuelling infrastructure does not exist. But the commercial fleets need a fuel that not only takes them from A to B but also allows them To hit their carbon reduction targets.\n\nAside from being a direct fuel source for trucks it seems that hydrogen production via electrolysis would be a natural place for RNG to be used. To be clear CLNE does not to the best of My knowledge sell RNG to the likes of BE or PLUG but if they continue to aggressively build out their methane capture capabilities why wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t RNG become a carbon negative fuel stock for hydrogen? Welcome other\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s thoughts who might know more. \n\nWhatever the short term fluctuations CLNE is a long term buy and hold. Stock has popped and there will be profit takers.

Hedge funds were taking huge short positions to speculate (force the price down) on certain securities in the market. The prime brokers and market makers (scums in this aspect and the ones who execute trades for these firms $$) were not good with borrowing the large amount of shares shorted. This resulted in large amount of fails to deliver by settlement which is called a naked short sale. That is why in 2004, the SEC approved Regulation SHO, to eliminate the manipulative practice of naked short selling. To start, Rule 200 of Regulation SHO (Rules for short selling) defines a short sale as 1. The sale of a security that the seller does not own. Basically they are selling something they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t own with a promise to give it back. \n\nThe current issue with these firms is that they are most likely breaking rule 203 of reg SHO that requires short sellers in all equity securities to locate these shares before they can be borrowed. This also has to be in writing prior to effecting the short sale. This rule states that the firm cannot execute a short sale for an account unless the security has been borrowed or an arrangement has been entered into to borrow the security; or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the security could be borrowed and delivered on settlement. The firms are obviously breaking this rule when the float of GME was 140%, meaning there are not enough shares to cover the current short selling on the stock. The SEC had these firms meet a test to determine the securities that are easy to borrow (can easily be borrowed and returned with low risk) and hard to borrow called threshold securities (hard to get and have high risk of not being able to deliver). This list is updated daily by the firm and the test can be met by getting a clients assurance they can deliver on settlement which must be documented. (Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s see Melvins..) \n\nThe rule used to be that if a customer failed to deliver, if they had not delivered after 13 consecutive settlement days following the trade a mandatory buy in occurred which the firm loses money on. In 2009, the SEC passed rule 204 after the financial crisis to make  naked short selling illegal and mentioning it being one of the key reasons for the 08\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 crash. This stated failed to deliver on any short sale has to be bought in no later then the day after settlement (T+3) resulting in losses for the firm. These rules are great if the SEC actually enforced them and held people/firms responsible. \n\nSince they are not, I am proud of this sub for creating the necessary spotlight on the scummy things Wall Street is still doing without any meaningful penalties by the SEC/FINRA. Main Street is actually making a impact to the future of trading in the best way possible, creating an equal field to battle big money. Who has the dumb money now Melvin? \n\nThank you if you read this far and hopefully it helped you a bit.\n\n(Edit)\nTL;DR:\nNaked short selling has been illegal since 2009, but is still occurring to this day and the SEC has not done anything to curb this behavior.

It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.\n\n**History**\n\nIn June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\nThe current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;\n\n**What is the business model of CHPT?**\n\nCharge Point sells hardware & software (equipment\u252c\u00e1& network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.\n\n**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**\n\n* Market Cap: \\~$7bn\n* Shares Float 299mln\n* Institutional ownership \\~13%\n* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;\n* TAM $190bn\n* Newly formed entity has no Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents \\~$650m.\n* Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with 41% Gross Margin.\n\nSource:[https://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf](https://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf)\n\n\u00ad\u0192\u00f4\u00c0\n\n$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are \"non-networked\", carving \\~53% market share of \"networked\" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \\~22% of the market pie, L2 \\~75% and L1, \\~3% of market share.\u252c\u00e1People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.\n\n**Products**\n\nComprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding\n\n**Software Enables** \\- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks\n\n**Challengers**\n\n* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better \"engagement\" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.\n* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).\n* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.\n* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*\"The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.\"*\n* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.\n\n**Near Term Catalysts**\n\nIn relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: \"AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.\"\n\nIt's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.\n\nThat's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.\n\n**Long Term Catalysts**\n\n\\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.\n\n$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.\n\n$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.\n\n$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.\n\nIn collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.\n\nNo1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.\n\nShareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.\n\n**MOAT**\n\n* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)\n* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)\n* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)\n* Network Effect ( \\~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nAll in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in green friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.\n\n**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**\n\nBecause it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.\n\nBecause it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home \"GAS station\".\n\nBecause EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.\n\nA small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.\n\nThis is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \\~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.\n\nAverage target price $38.21", "votes": 28, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9993, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 16:51:52", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:06:51", "reddit_post_id": "nuhc91"}, "230": {"post_id": 14522, "author_id": 611247, "post_title": "TICKER FOMC Making Headlines", "self_text": "\nI\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve realized when I talk about this stock most people have no idea what it is.

And for full disclosure, I just bought in the other day, currently sitting only on 100 shares, but planning to increase by next week to 500 or 1,000 shares.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n52 Week Low: 1.58\n\n52 Week High: 29.44\n\nCurrent Price: 11.68\n\nAvg Volume: 21.14M\n\nShares Outstanding: 322.43M\n\nFloat: 309.25M\n\nShort Interest: 45.46M (\\~14.70% short)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00f3 Highlighted Fundamentals (from Q4 2020)-\n\n1. Market Cap - \\~$3.65Bn\n2. 4th Qtr Revenue- Increased 54% to $17Mill\n3. 4th Qtr Net Loss- Decreased nearly 50% ($18.9mill compared to $35.2mill in 2019)\n4.

This factor tied with increased revenues means the company can identify areas to trim unnecessary expenses, all while increasing the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s absolute value.\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00f3 A couple negatives:\n\n1. Out of the 4 international offices/locations, only 1 of them is company owned, the remainder are leased properties (though many corporations lease properties)\n2. The company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s financials do not show any product sales data for 2020, however revenue mainly consists of service agreements and license revenues.\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00f3 FCEL company future:\n\n1. The company has a promising future which repeated US Gov\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t grants for research/development, commercialization and other necessities for energy-type requests; which includes: (1) Advancing High Efficiency Power Generation, (2) Advancing High Efficiency Electrolysis \\[this will help produce hydrogen more efficiently and from Water\\].\n2. 2. FCEL had entered into a joint development agreement with ExxonMobil3. Recently announced to join Hydrogen Europe, which will allow locations in the EU to utilize the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s fuel cell platforms for clean energy.\n\nIn relation to other energy focused companies (such as PLUG), FCEL is priced considerably less, with even smaller Market Capacity. When compared specifically to PLUG (which had an EPS of -$1.46 vs FCEL\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s -$0.37), I would be tempted to think FCEL has a lot of potential upside, especially given the near future in relation to clean energy.\n\nWhen FCEL reaches PLUG\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s Market Cap, the price per share will be $53.84.  That is a potential upside of 460%.  \n\nFCEL's Q1 Report comes out on 6/11.

Oftentimes as investors, we all have what-if scenarios and regrets about not capitalizing on an opportunity at its infancy.\n\nAs it goes, when a new industry is about to break out, there will always be two sides: those who believe and those who doubt. History either remembers you as a winner or a loser.\n\nWhat if I told you the energy industry is about to make history now? That\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s right, reminiscing of the early days of e-commerce and EVs, today LNG is what these industries were at their childhood stages.\n\n# So what\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s the deal with natural gas (LNG)?\n\nAccording to forecasts, the current demand for LNG in 2021 is around 300mpta, and is looking to more than double to 700mpta by 2040. This is evident considering our world is in the process of a transition from coal and high emission energy production, LNG demand keeps increasing every year establishing itself the ultimate cost-efficient solution for a transition to cleaner energy.\n\n>And while in an ideal way we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6d prefer to skip LNG and go directly into clean renewables, reality doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t paint the same picture.\n\nSimply put, there isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t enough supply for the huge demand we require. Not only that, but for a lot of developing countries, the question isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t even how do we clean our emissions? It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s for all intents and purposes how do we even produce enough energy?\n\nThis is where Tellurian Inc. (NASDAQ:TELL) plays its cards. Founded in 2016 by the godfather of LNG Charif Souki and his longtime associate Martin Houston, Tellurian aims to build a natural gas business of approximately 27.6mpta/year through their Louisiana Driftwood LNG terminal.\n\n>This ambitious project would put it as the biggest LNG terminal of North America thus far.\n\n# Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s look at the company\n\nLeadership wise, the company is led by the best men in the industry. The veteran board of directors not only is accredited to have delivered 18% of LNG today, but have a clear vision for a booming gas industry. With their integrated business model and favorable gas prices (According to JKM, TTF and Henry Hubs spot prices), the company has successfully signed two 3mtpa long-terms deals with two global players (Gunvor and Vitol) in the last two weeks, with no signs of stopping eithers on the road to complete the 11mtpa/year requirement to complete Phase 1 one of the project.\n\n>The company boasts a strong balance sheet with no debt, and has successfully secured all the necessary building permits (By no means an easy thing with clean energy lobbies).\n\nTherefore, and as predicted, the next step is starting construction at some point during this summer. In the upcoming weeks, we should see even more action, as the company is looking to close even more, perhaps bigger deals especially with Korea, whom they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been strengthening their relationship with for the past months.\n\n>But despite it and like any stock, certain risk management has to be assessed.\n\nFor instance one of the earliest equity partners, Total S.A, has shed more than 23 million shares over the past months. The exact reason for this is unknown, but most analysts are wary. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s also noteworthy that according to an agreement by the two parties, Total would have to buy 20 million shares at 12$ if Tellurian secures FID (Final Investment Decision) by June, a task they failed so far.\n\nCoincidentally, should Tellurian not reach FID by the required date, Total is free to completely walk out of the arrangement without repercussions. Should this be a big concern? We know that the management has anticipated and as expected flexed the plan so that dependency on Total is no longer required at all in the long run. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s also just as important to bring up the fact Total is going through a complete rebranding after their two failed LNG startups in Mozambique and Myanmar, both halted due to armed conflicts in the area and estimated to cost them billions of damage. So maybe this divorce won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be so bad after all.\n\nYou may also find the use of an ATM (At The Market Offering) over the course of the year an important variable to reflect on before investing. According to the 2020 Q4 report, and 2021 Q1 report, the company has utilized ATM three times over the course of the year to raise upwards of 200mil$. And while you usually hate to see the shares diluted, you have to respect the end goal behind it, as the company looked to raise enough money to clear the balance sheet and stay debt free, as well as resuming drilling and acquiring more upstream reserves.\n\nAccording to Souki himself, it was stated ATM would only be used if absolutely necessary and if it benefits the company as a whole. The manner and timing in which it was executed was very calculated as well and minimized any potential side effects we could\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve had from this dilution. In the future, the company has maintained its strong position of not needing any more ATMs to raise cash.\n\n# Stock price action\n\nSo what\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s the stock price like? Have I missed the hype? Well let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s just say there are three trains. The short term train left exactly two weeks ago, the mid term is waiting for passengers, and the long term one hasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t arrived yet.\n\nAt the time of this article, the stock is trading at around 5$, consistently breaking peak after peak for the year, after having traded as low as 1.7$ a few months ago, and having traded on average around 2.3$ for most of the year. Unless something supernatural happens, we will not see below 4$ anymore.\n\nFor an optimal mid-term entry point, anything below <4$ is considered a steal, with loading up at 5$ or higher no slouch either. We predict that in the short term stock will rise at the very least above 6.5$, with a potential to break 10$ once Phase 1 is fully concluded and construction is at full swing.\n\n# This writer\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s opinion\n\nSpeaking long-term, we are looking at a ten bagger here if you were to buy now and everything goes according to plan. With conserative estimates ranging at around +40$, that is if we use the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s own predicted 7$ FCF at full operations to estimate a realistic share price. Any share picked up at <10$ will be a steal when operations are in full swings and deliveries are being made.\n\nSo here\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s the big question, do you believe in the leadership\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s ability to succeed? Because if you do, this is your chance to end up at the right side of history when the remark \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3Man I should\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve bought TELL when it was 5$\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 pops up.\n\nSource: [https://medium.com/@streetcred/tellurian-the-company-that-reminds-you-of-stocks-you-missed-out-on-a5904601a0a5](https://medium.com/@streetcred/tellurian-the-company-that-reminds-you-of-stocks-you-missed-out-on-a5904601a0a5)\n\nFor more DD: [https://twitter.com/streetcred\\_app](https://twitter.com/streetcred_app)", "votes": 15, "post_title_sentiment": -0.296, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9977, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 00:27:40", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:06:59", "reddit_post_id": "nurv5o"}, "238": {"post_id": 14530, "author_id": 555981, "post_title": "Trading the SPY 0DTE: What I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve learned and the questions that remain.", "self_text": "Hello! So I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been trading the SPY 0DTE for two months now. I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been up %150, down %96 and then back again. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s been a lot of fun and I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve learned a lot from it. I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6d like to share some of my observations and see what opinions others have on this monumentally stupid trade!\n\nWhy Do I Like the SPY 0DTE? Honestly I feel less confident in trying to predict long term prices on anything these days. SPY has been so incredibly range bound that weekly or monthly options seem like a pure theta play. Hence why I like the 0DTE. If you can find one good trend for the day, your tendies will come. But only if you follow these rules:\n\n1. Get in and get out! \nI like to just pop in for a %10 gain and then get the hell out of there. In fact my biggest loss occurred when I thought I could milk out a higher gain. I was in a bull trap and it never came back. The 0DTE is a wave, you can ride it but if you don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t get out of it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s way it will kill you.\n\n2. Find an indicator that works for you.\nThis sub isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t crazy about TA, and understandably so. But coin flipping to find your momentum for the day is even worse. So YouTube some different strategies and see what works best for you. Personally, I really like using the 2 supertrends. I also learned to love Heikin Ashi with MAs and a really neat little indicator called Prings Special K (invented by a ketamine enthusiast lol)\n\n3. Sell slightly below the ask price.\nI got burned for a %25 loss today after Robinhood couldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t fill my order. This can happen on such a tight timeframe and especially if you are approaching the end of a price move. I was fortunate in that I was able to salvage my account by selling it for slightly less than the asking price and my order was filled immediately.\n\nNow a %10 gain might not sound like fun after what this sub has been experiencing for the past week, but a month of hitting these 0DTEs will double your account. My best streak was 15, hoping I can get there again.\n\nDoes anyone else\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s trade this?

There are no options on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so stop asking for strikes and expiry.  Why?  The Supreme Court may issue an opinion this month that releases Fannie and Freddie from the FHFA's conservatorship.  Were this to happen, Fannie and Freddie would no longer need pay their entire profit margin to the government, and the Feds might actually have to pay back to the companies the entire excess above the bailout received:  $110 BILLION. \n\n\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\nIn 2017, Fannie Mae (Fannie) and Freddie Mac (Freddie) shareholders sued then Sec. of Treasury Mnuchin, (now called Collins v. Yellen, after the administration change), that is now waiting on an opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS or the Court).\n\nThe Shareholders argue that Fannie and Freddie were unlawfully placed into a conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), because FHFA's creation violates the separation of powers.\n\nThe questions present to the Court SCOTUS are:\n\n1.\t\u00d4\u00fc\u00e1\u00d4\u00fc\u00e1Whether FHFA\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s structure violates the separation of powers; and\n\n2.\t\u00d4\u00fc\u00e1\u00d4\u00fc\u00e1Whether courts must set aside a final agency action when the agency was unconstitutionally structured and strike down the statutory provisions that make FHFA independent.\n\n\"Ginger, what the fuck does that mean?\"\n\nWell, for all you non lawyers, those with a fifth grade education from the good ole US of A should know that separation of powers means the legislative, executive, and judicial branches must act independently of one another.  If they do not, and, for example, the executive branch creates a government agency to oversee the mortgage collateralization without a direct authorization from Congress, the agency is unconstitutional and all its actions are therefore invalid.\n\nSuch are the arguments made in the Petitioners' case:  if FHFA was structured unconstitutionally, therefore, all of FHFA's actions, including the action to place Fannie and Freddie into a conservatorship, were unconstitutional.\n\n\"Ginger, so what?  I still don't see rocket ship emojis, and Fannie Mae doesn't rhyme with Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry.\"\n\nWell, my smooth brained degenerate, as part of its actions, the FHFA created a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement whereby Fannie and Freddie must pay, to the government their entire net worth on a quarterly basis, minus a small capital buffer.\n\n\"Ginger, I still don't get it.\"\n\nWow.  You really are an orangutan.  Back when most of you were hiding your boners with a textbook when changing classes, a little thing called the Great Recession happened. At an extremely high level, that even an ape can understand:  Banks did bad things.  These bad things were bought by Fannie and Freddie.  The bad things Fannie and Freddie bought almost wiped them out if not for a government bailout.  As part of bailout, the government now receives a \"dividend\" equal to all of the Companies profit on a quarterly basis.  This is called the Net Worth Sweep.\n\n\"Ginger, is that a big deal?\"\n\nDuh.  Fannie has $3.5 Trillion in assets on its books.  The next closes company, is JP Morgan at 2 Trillion.  Fannie alone has 75% more assets than the next closest company.  If you're thinking \"Holy fuck\", you're right.\n\n\"Ginger, but wait does this mean the Court is going to give Fannie and Freddie back the money and stop holding its balance sheet hostage?\"\n\nI don't know, but I sure fucking hope so!  SCOTUS is grappling with a situation where FHFA is unconstitutional and what will happen with all the money the conservatorship collected over the last 12 years. (SCOTUS won't decide what to do with the money - it will decide the questions of federal and constitutional law, and kick the decision back to the Circuit and District Courts to issue the order consistent with its opinion.)\n\n\"Ginger, what kind of profit could we be looking at?\"\n\nFannie is trading at $2.3 per share right now.  Fannie does $25 Billion in revenues a year.  At a conservative 4x multiple, Fannie is a $100B company.  At a 20x multiple, $500B.\n\n\"Ginger, why do I have to buy now?\"\n\nThe Court releases opinions usually on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and on the third Monday of each sitting. The Court goes into summer recess at the end of the month and its next term doesn't start until Sept. - Oct. Collins was argued back in December, and its possible an opinion will be issued before the end of the current term.

And I even realize why this idea seems intuitive because its leverage would allow it to climb out of the hole faster.\n\nAs usual, recency bias is rearing its ugly head.\n\nFirst, this post has nothing to do with the oft-cited boogeyman of LETFs known as *volatility decay* or *beta slippage* of the fund itself. In short, [it's not as big of a deal as it's made out to be](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php). I'm a fan of LETFs. I use them myself and I *do* \"hold them for more than a day.\"\n\nSecondly, this is also ignoring the fact that QQQ is basically a tech fund at this point. The market is already over 1/4 tech, and [Growth is looking expensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/ixpset/great_video_for_those_who_like_to_bet_on_large/). I neither own nor recommend owning QQQ or TQQQ. TQQQ just seems to be very popular and is the subject of most of these LETF posts, but this concept could obviously apply to 100% UPRO as well (which I do own).\n\nDrawdowns are the kryptonite here. Here's that graph I mentioned:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2vt2i2vcw371.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60ac73b94453fac27093d50a3c313bb4f1ea9ca\n\nAs a simplistic example using dollars, suppose your $100 portfolio drops by 10% ($10) to $90. You now require an 11% gain to get back to $100.\n\nThe stellar soaring of Big Tech over the past decade has resulted in huge inflows into the fund, and its performance during that time looks fantastic. Here's TQQQ's inception in 2010 through 2020, over which time it's up over 5,000%:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com](https://preview.redd.it/m0jf7h4ydw371.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dcd0f2ec88933b0e49ce75bb6fa9cadc5c63112)\n\nLooks great, right? But as we know, past performance does not indicate future performance. Moreover, a decade \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 especially one without a major crash \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 is a terribly short amount of time from which to draw any sort of meaningful conclusions.\n\nSo we need to go back further to get a better idea of how TQQQ performs (or *would have* performed, at least) through major stock market crashes. I created some simulation data so that we can do just that by simulating returns going back further than the fund\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s inception. Going back to 1987 - when the NASDAQ 100 started - for TQQQ vs. QQQ tells a somewhat different story:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com](https://preview.redd.it/2hq53oizcw371.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=c264a2ad929157c9036ebae2bc4924f4af780f34)\n\nNotice how buying TQQQ alone is basically a timing gamble that depends heavily on your entry and exit points. Basically, it can take too long for the leveraged ETF to recover after a major crash. After the Dotcom crash of 2000, TQQQ didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t catch up to QQQ until late 2007 right before it crashed again in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.

We need to mitigate those harmful drawdowns. As usual, diversification is your friend, especially with LETFs. As with the famous Hedgefundie Adventure (Google it), TMF (3x long treasuries) should probably be the primary hedge of choice. (Yes, interest rates falling for the past 40 years has resulted in great performance for long bonds. Whether or not long treasuries will provide the same protection in the future that they have in the past is another conversation, but here we're just looking for an insurance policy for crashes via uncorrelation and hopefully *negative* correlation, even in a low/zero/rising rate environment.)\n\nYou can extend this idea with other assets like gold, too, obviously, to further lower volatility and mitigate drawdowns, which is what Bridgewater's All Weather Fund attempts to do.\n\n60/40 TQQQ/TMF for effective 180/120 exposure looks the best historically and dominated the funds held in isolation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com](https://preview.redd.it/oodubfm3dw371.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=53281359b9b54ee450654313e61b6ddf6851396d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What about regular deposits?\n\nThe backtests above use a starting balance of $10,000 and no additional deposits. Some will reflexively point out that an investor will usually be regularly depositing into the portfolio and that this would change the results because you can \"bUy ThE dIpS.\" Since the market tends to go up (it spends most of its time at all-time highs) and since major crashes are typically infrequent, regular deposits of $1,000/month actually don't change the end result:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com](https://preview.redd.it/jpdbm905dw371.png?width=1794&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb77230c39e8088c8e9cc1a0aa8fec6d9b22dede)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**  Drawdowns matter sometimes.

Who actually starts it?", "self_text": "With all that is going on, I don't believe that the significant price fluctuations and stock volatility of AMC, GME, and all the other meme stocks are actually started by retail investors. I believe it is and has always been started by institutional investors with big money.\n\nTo cause the price of a stock to increase significantly in a short period of time requires a lot of money. It is odd to see the majority of meme stocks to coincidently go up significantly out of the blue at the same time on the same day/week when the stocks were trading sideways for months. I don't believe meme stock retail traders all got together on the same day and time and purchased a ton of stocks causing the price to go up significantly even though it might seem that way.\n\nMy theory is that the big banks know that most meme stock dedicated traders are all fired up for these stocks. They capitalize on this by purchasing significant amounts of meme stocks (AMC, GME, BB, etc.) all at the same time in hopes that they would start a frenzy for at least one of those meme stocks. When a frenzy does start, there are several narratives that retail investors and even news outlets then use to explain the frenzy. 1. short squeeze. 2 options activity, etc. etc. But, the case here is, who starts it? The better question is: who are the only investors able to start a frenzy? Big banks with a lot of money. They know who they're trading against, and their strategy is to utilize retail traders to their advantage by taking control of the perception of the market all the way through. Why would they want to start a frenzy? To sell off at the top with the help of retail investors. Because, right now, it seems that everyone thinks it's retail traders driving the price when that might not actually be the case at all.\n\nThe problem here is that there is a lack of transparency that the big banks take advantage of and it's important because now it seems the SEC is trying to lay regulations that would affect trading on the retail side. The issue here isn't with retail investors, but the lack of transparency of why and how a price of a stock increases significantly.\n\nThe solution? For starters, require brokerages to display data on big, large volume institutional purchases/sales (on what SEC considers meme-stocks) in real time to retail investors to prevent narratives that intend to blindly shift the blame of price fluctuations and stock volatility on retail investors. In my opinion, it's always the big banks that start the frenzy, and I believe the \"trading frenzy\" will keep happening until there is full transparency.

We believe pet is a growing and highly attractive category that is early in the shift online (\\~30% penetration in 2020), and in our view Chewy is well positioned as the leader in online pet with a \\~50% market share. We believe Chewy has multiple top-line drivers that support sustained 20%+ growth (+17% secular growth, Pharmacy, services, & international expansion), with profitability pulled-forward and sustainable as some of the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s fastest growth areas are also its highest margin (i.e. private label, Pharmacy).

Net Sales of $2.04B (+51% Y/Y) came in well above the high-end of mgmt's $1.94B-$1.96B guide (+43-45% Y/Y) & buyside client expectations of \\~$2B (\\~48% Y/Y) based on our conversations. Growth was driven by Active Customers of 19.2M (+43% Y/Y, +8% Q/Q) & Net Sales per Active Customer of $372 (+3% Y/Y).

CHWY noted only 35% of customers are exposed to proprietary brands today & its healthcare offering is utilized by <20% of customers\u00d4\u00c7\u00f6plenty of runway ahead. Gross Margin of 27.1% represented CHWY\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s best GM in history & increased \\~300bps Y/Y. Half of the leverage was due to growth in higher-margin verticals (hardgoods, proprietary brands, & healthcare) and the other half due to a favorable pricing & promotional environment.

CHWY noted most of the positive momentum in FY20 has carried over into FY21, with QTD customer acquisition & spending trends remaining strong. Mgmt does expect some inventory challenges in the wet food category, an industrywide issue that is likely to persist until summer. However, CHWY should be better positioned than competitors given its ability to prioritize inventory for its Autoship customers.  Turning to profit, CHWY guided to FY21 EBITDA margin expansion of +50-100bps Y/Y, or 1.7%-2.2% margin.

It's doomed.", "self_text": "Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.  I simply see an opportunity for me to make money from an upcoming conflict between competitors that I'm already confident has been lost before it really begins.  I thought i'd share.\n\n**Viasat** is a company that provides satellite broadband connectivity in the form of residential services, airliner connectivity, and government (primarily military).\n\nThey're 1.6B in debt, and they make about $7M net per quarter.  To quote their [recent earnings report](https://investors.viasat.com/static-files/393791ed-ba16-4116-a556-cebf19ae5eb1):\n\n\"Although we expect continued revenue growth, margins likely will be somewhat pressured by new market entry costs and, later in the fiscal year, infrastructure expenses associated with the ViaSat-3 (Americas) launch.\"\n\nSo their already razor thin (well below the industry standard) margins are going to decrease.  They are launching 3 new satellites as part of their ViaSat-3 constellation.  They seem to expect to make this up via the increased bandwidth and subscribers they'll get with these new satellites.\n\n2021Q4 Revenue was broken down thusly: \n\n**Government Services: $280.8M**\n\n**Residential Services: $230.3M**\n\n**Commercial Networks: $84.7M**\n\nAgain, net income was $7M net.  Razor thin margins (they expect to get thinner) for a company with so much debt.\n\nAll that said, they're doing an admirable job with what resources they have.  **What you won't find mentioned in their earnings report is exactly what's going to crush their already modest net revenue: SpaceX's Starlink.**\n\nFirst, lets compare their residential broadband services:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mfzdjpcxsw371.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=d697e367ec03c33f3fb2c72210f3020adafcae32\n\nNote 1: Data retrieved from Viasat's website via a quote for (its premium) service in a rural area.\n\n  \nNote 2: Although high speed is capped on Viasat, it is throttled after the 150GB (200GB in some areas), so subscribers won't be entirely cut off after exceeding the cap.\n\nNote 3: The Starlink info was from averages of real-world testing with a speedtest taken every 3 hours for 26 days.\n\nAs you can see.....  there's really no comparison.  Starlink is currently on a limited beta, which is expected to end sometime in Summer 2021.  I expect many of its customers are already switching to Starlink despite its beta status, but that exodus of residential subscribers will likely turn into a tsunami by the end of 2021.\n\nNext up is why its government revenue is also in danger:  [The Department of Defense is testing it.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/spacex-prepares-for-air-force-test-of-starlink-satellite-internet.html)  The duration of the tests is expected to last \"4 to six months\".  That article is from 12 March.  If you do the math, you'll see that the DOD's testing will end at the same time Starlink comes out of beta.  That's a huge double-whammy to Viasat's two biggest revenue sources.\n\nThe last revenue source is commercial internet (think airlines' \"in-flight wifi\", commercial shipping connectivity, etc): [That market too, is under attack by SpaceX.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/spacex-asks-to-test-starlink-satellite-internet-with-a-gulfstream-jet.html)\n\nSo that's it..... that's what they do... they provide satellite broadband.  They're launching 3 new satellites, which will be obsolete before they're even in orbit, that will come with increased operating costs.... which will eat into their razor thin margins.  Additionally, they are relying on increased subscribers to offset those cost at the exact time prospective new and existing subscribers will obviously be signing up for Starlink.  They don't appear able to handle even a moderate loss of residential subscribers.... much less a large one while also losing government and commercial contracts.\n\nDisclosure: I have 10 puts at a $25 strike with an expiry in Jan 2023, and another at $50.", "votes": 6, "post_title_sentiment": -0.6369, "self_text_sentiment": -0.8894, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 21:40:47", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:07:25", "reddit_post_id": "nuoejq"}, "260": {"post_id": 14552, "author_id": 262897, "post_title": "Marble EFT Report", "self_text": "Goooood evening apes! \n\nI've got some updated graphs for you and an interesting pick tonight with the marbles, but first things first lets recap the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[red hots anyone?](https://preview.redd.it/mgpkzipyux371.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=248518d3fe9111a4751611a7e022381f48345205)\n\nIt was a red day for the ETF with $CRSR -0.63%, USO -0.15%, and CLNE -0.68% bringing in the average of -0.48% for the day.

I am intentionally being very conservative with my estimates.\n\nNow while it has not been officially stated, I just heard on NPR that the Alzheimer\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s regimen will cost $56,000 per year. Whether that is the price or not, I think we can all agree that whatever it is, it is going to be a shit ton of money.\n\nFor the purpose of this calculation, I am only going to consider US customers, however, the real TAM is much larger. (Currently there are 6 million cases in the US.)[https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures]\n\n\\[I took the rest of the statistics from Biogen\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s income statement.\\]( [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BIIB/financials/annual/income-statement](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BIIB/financials/annual/income-statement))\n\nFor a very simple valuation model, I used p/e multiplier and price/rev multiplier.\n\nSince some of this announcement was probably baked in to the price already, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll go back to 12/30/20. The closing price was $243.58.\n\nThe EPS in 2020 was $24.80 giving an earnings multiplier of 9.82x.\n\nThe revenue per share in 2020 was $12,356 million/161 million shares = 76.74, so the price/rev last year was 243.58/76.74 = 3.17.\n\nAs a very conservative estimate, let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s assume just 10% of those with Alzheimer\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s take the drug. This alone will increase BIIB\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s revenue per share by 600,000 x $56,000 / 161 million shares = 208.70.\n\nUsing the revenue multiplier, this implies a fair price of $243.58 + 208.70 x 3.17 = $905 per share!\n\nNow based on earnings, according to their income statement, last years net margin was 32.38%. This drug alone will increase their EPS by 600,000 x $56,000 \\* 32.38%/161 million shares = $65.58. Using the earnings multiplier, this implies a fair price of $243.58 + $65.58 x 9.82 = $907 per share.\n\nNow, sure, it is not yet proven to work, but they are authorized to put in on the market for 9 years while they do further research. I am also aware that this revenue won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t last forever. Eventually it will fall off patent and they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re profits will decrease.

While all of you are creaming your pants losing 50% of your money by repeatedly throwing it into a furnace of GME calls fueled by the theta flames of hell, let me introduce you to a better way.\n\nCRISPR.\n\nFor those of you who don't know what the fuck this random buzzword that sounds like a hip burnt pizza restaurant is, let me summarize for you:\n\n - Scientists (smarter than you) found a neat little protein in bacteria called cas9 in 2005 that did something really cool. It was able to take scissors, and cut out fuckups from its DNA that were introduced by viruses. Think of it like a bacteria that can get HIV, and then delete it.\n\n - Turns out, cas9 is really fucking versatile, and could defend against nearly *all* viruses that the bacteria would regularly encounter, because of CRISPR genes in the bacteria. You don't need to care about what it stands for, just think about it like duplicates of non-infecting DNA from viruses. The cas9 complex then takes the synthesizing RNA for these sequences (try really hard to remember 9th grade bio), grabs onto it, and uses it as a guideline to scissor out the bad DNA.\n\n - After some fucking around, scientists recently have been able to give little cas9 bro almost **any** RNA and it can take it, and use it as a guide to remove DNA that matches it.\n\nSo what does this mean for humans?\n\n - In 2016 Editas Medicine went public, becoming the first company to focus on eventual clinical studies of using CRISPR-Cas9 complex in humans to modify their DNA to cure incurable diseases. \n\n - In january 2021, the company received clinical green light for trials for **sickle cell** patients.\n\n   - What is sickle cell? A really fucked up disease where your blood is the wrong shape and it causes life-long pain and poor ability to absorb oxygen correctly. The only therapeutic procedures for this are extremely expensive apheresis treatments in which sickled cells are removed and replaced with good cells, which eventually die and become sickled again, requiring constant therapeutic treatment for patients.\n\n - There are 4.4 million people with sickle cell disease, *all* of whom would be very glad for an actual long term treatment.\n\nSure okay okay, but what does this mean for retards like me with regular shaped blood? Well you are in luck, because this company with the potential to become one of the largest medical companies in the world is only sitting at $2.4B market cap. A company with the most CRISPR research, and the most clinical trial experience in CRISPR therapy, has a market cap of about 10% of a dying video game reseller. A company that could cure all cancers, cure HIV, even let rich people pay for super babies, is only $2.4B. \n\nIf clinical trials for sickle cell go well (we will find out before EOY), you can bet your wife's boyfriend's left and right nuts that EDIT will 10x and then 10x again before 2023.

If $53 goes should pick up some selling momentum but until then I'd say bulls have the advantage today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e64vzjxbgv371.png?width=2091&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db94bcb16a1d773ff05b653bf4fa9c7426b0ac9\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ug11k896gv371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=a10581ac94699f6114975d5496296a0ba416b923", "votes": 0, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.6876, "date_posted": "2021-06-07 16:41:37", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 00:07:40", "reddit_post_id": "nuh335"}, "273": {"post_id": 14565, "author_id": 557096, "post_title": "I TRIED TO WARN YOU BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!!!!! ASO!!!!!!!!!", "self_text": "So......\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI been talking about ASO for a few weeks now.  I started when it was maybe 31.  It's over 37.9 now.  more than 20 percent up since I brought it to your attention.  What I came to understand with all the filtered posts, abuse, riding my ass, and other genreally negative feedback, is that this community has unique standards for what qualifies as a stock worth going in on.  You see, read back to the original GME posts and I was all the same bullshit: \"B&M store\", \"doomed to fail\", \"OK BOOMER\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen GME exploded and it made WallStreetBets famous.  It exposed the corrupt and hateful behavior of hedge funds, and millions of people piled on to WSB in the hopes of catching the next wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem:  You're all retards.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere have been fundamental changes in the way hedge funds operate now because of us.  Yes WallStreetBets kicked ass and changed the world, but YOU didn't.  YOU might have gotten lucky and hopped on when GME was 17 and rode it to 34, hopped off, hopped back on at 70, hopped off at 80, hopped on at 190, etc etc etc.  You also hopped on and off as it went down. losing money most of the time. Some people made good money, or are the true diamondhands we all wish we are, but the great majority are just plebs giving our money to smarter traders, making small gains here and there, etc.  \n\nAnd the majority of YOU are also now jumping on AMC, BB, etc.  Not having any idea really what is going to happen, making or losing money as the wind blows, thinking you are part of a movement that is leveling the playing field for apes and retards.  So what does someone like YOU do???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I'm here to help! (disclaimer: I'm NOT here to help)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what you're missing:\n\nThe way GME happened, the way BB and AMC and MVIS and BNGO happened, isn't by your FOMO fool ass jumping in (actually the tail part of it is but we'll get to that later), it happened because DD's occurred with critical analysis of stocks that were undervalued were placed here, and some smart people OTHER than you read it and understood it.  They bought and held for months, bringing up the floor value of the stock long enough that some other reasonably smart but less responsible investors took notice.  Then when they got in the price went up more, until a LOT of people noticed.  A lot of YOU people.  Of course you jumped in with FOMO, but you jumped in as they started selling off.  Then you started posting desperate attempts to get the stock to go up but you have no karma and have nothing meaningful to add so your paosts got filtered and all you could do is post \"me too\" like some brain dead AOL'er on other peoples posts.  \n\nThe era of GME and 80+ percent shorted stocks is gone now.  You changed that.  You didn't profit from it but you got the frenzy going, participated in it, and kicked Melvin's ass.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what to do now?  Stop chasing! Yes you might win a casino bet concerning AMC now but ultimately (and AMC agrees), the stock is way over valued now and most of you are going to lose money.  Also, like all casino bets, ultimately the casino wins.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery once in a while a stock comes up here that is undervalued and has enough short interest, etc, that you might get a nice gamma squeeze out of it.  I think the best bet is to look at those, CRITICALLY, and decide if it's worth throwing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEN WAIT.\n\nIf the stock is actually undervalued (like BB, AMC, GME were originally), you might get a nice pop, an incredible pop even.  But patience is key, and even if you don't get a pop the stock will still do well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this have to do with ASO?  Well its undervalued, fairly shorted, mostly institutionally owned, and waiting to get noticed.  Should you buy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWELL  IT'S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!  \n\nTHE STOCK ANNOUNCES EARNINGS TOMORROW MORNING YOU IDIOT!!! TOO LATE TO BUY CALLS.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI WARNED YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

Since then, I feel that all \"squeeze\" and \"meme\" stocks have been psychologically grouped as the same, but their trends show they are not.\n\n**The simple hypothesis?** We should be able to easily differentiate the Jan stocks as compared to any of the others that gained attention post-January.\n\nThere was a defined and unique occurrence that took place back in Jan surrounding $GME, $AMC, $BB, $KOSS, $NOK, $BBBY, and Express. Since then, we have seen a wave of \"short squeeze\" narratives for other tickers, but the difference around the January stocks was how they appeared to all move in tandem and have a relatively strong correlation, setting them apart, and potential pointing to some broader scheme involved utilizing naked shorting and resulting in massive FTDs.\n\nIt goes to say this is an anomaly and I believe these stocks should be looked at differently when compared with other \"squeeze\" and \"meme\" stocks being pushed.\n\n**Side Note:** For these charts, all tickers will be set to full screen scaling on Trading View in order to see how closely their trends in price action move together, so it's not comparative of current price per share but of their general movements, when those movements took place, and individual gains.\n\nSome of the \"squeeze\" stocks that followed January's events, $CLOV, $RKT, and $MVIS, compared with $GME over a 6 month basis. $GME because it was the most notable Jan stock historically until recently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as \\\\\"meme\\\\\" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.](https://preview.redd.it/3jgm7j8rl1471.png?width=3335&format=png&auto=webp&s=457655244d8a809517d4a68c9ce168804f2d2f41)\n\nIt may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as \"meme\" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.\n\n**What can I infer from this, just from looking at it?**\n\n$CLOV has done its own thing until closer to late March when it first started getting attention (again) after the massive influx of WSB participants post-Jan. Even so, if you look close enough, it has peaks and valleys that move against the trend of $GME.\n\n$MVIS also definitely follows its own tune.\n\n$RKT is actually the one of these 3 that looks like it could follow $GME, but it didn't \"squeeze\" in Jan with the others. It had a massive run up in the beginning of March that sticks out against the others.\n\nIt appears to me that it was really around March that this psychological collective was starting to be established as we see a little less divergence in trends, though they are still identifiable as different.\n\nNow compare $GME and $AMC. Although $AMC didn't run up in March, if you study these lines, you can see there consistent moves up and down at the same time as $GME until recently May.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC bucked the trend the past few weeks and reached highs greater than the Jan peak.](https://preview.redd.it/fwbvwknvl1471.png?width=3323&format=png&auto=webp&s=330b350435447aabf0827de1b0f003ccb5e20d32)\n\nAMC bucked the trend the past few weeks and reached highs greater than the Jan peak.\n\nThe other 3 without $GME on the chart.\n\n[Kinda all over the place when you look at them in isolation and compared to each other.](https://preview.redd.it/af55m8gxl1471.png?width=3325&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ceacfa257d8c8db7ec97530f0f5e3143a53221)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKinda all over the place when you look at them in isolation and compared to each other.\n\nNow if you're not sure there seems to be that much divergence, look at the Jan stocks together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Because Big Money got scared and said fuck you](https://preview.redd.it/fk3i4r6am1471.png?width=3324&format=png&auto=webp&s=2806febf5c6904813f452ea47f165a322418f85e)\n\nJanuary peak when they triple fucked us says it all.\n\nThis may be a shoddy effort to show the differences I'm trying to highlight, but I think if anyone were to take the time to play around with some charts and overlay the tickers, you can see just from basic visual analysis that there is extreme similarity in all of the Jan stocks over 6 months, suggesting they are in their own bucket entirely independent of other \"meme\" stocks.\n\nIf we take the time to compare Jan stocks 1 on 1 with others, it highlights this difference.\n\nI'll use Express here because no one talks about it but it has Jan stock correlation. This tells me that it isn't sentiment driven and is seemingly moving with other Jan stocks for another reason that isn't \"retail\" pumping it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Express and CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/ns66q7mzl1471.png?width=3337&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43dc1801e4f19503b88e13e7850d6cf09a01eea)\n\n[Express and RKT](https://preview.redd.it/c5gglej0m1471.png?width=3334&format=png&auto=webp&s=4af8b13a259c703ea76d6fccfa5417f773001caf)\n\n[Express and MVIS](https://preview.redd.it/1jw67jw1m1471.png?width=3335&format=png&auto=webp&s=04483e9f508589c143e4f3fe1a858ebf647efb9d)\n\n[Express and UWMC](https://preview.redd.it/erqfqgz2m1471.png?width=3330&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b5f08737f56ea50e6ae132e8ea8e11b9e73b8ae)\n\n**Why did I bother to go through all of this?**\n\nI think it's important to provide some distinction between the events of Jan and those respective stocks as compared to the more recent favorites.

I didnt see any sources and contradictory information so I thought its time to do my own DD and share with you fellow apes.\n\nWhat was released yesterday:\n\nBasically it was 2 informations that were announced yesterday by sec filings, that I will go into here in clother detail.\n\n**1. 8-K Sec Report:**\nThis is basically the information about the issueing of shares by CLNE through Goldman Sachs or alternatively towards Goldman Sachs at market prices. CLNE had such an agreement before that allowed it to sell shares up to a Volume in USD of 100M. The new agreement in the report does also allow CLNE to sell shares up to a volume of 100M USD from time to time in the future when they want to. This is important, as yesterday some statements mentioned that it would be 100M shares which is not the case. At current marketvalue of CLNE we are speaking of 5% of the company which would lead to, when fully used, a dilution of 5% but on the other hand giving CLNE 100M to invest in infrastructure etc.      \nWithin the supplement to the 8-k it describes it as follows:     \n*We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for developing\r\nand acquiring RNG production projects, building fueling stations to\r\nsupport contracted RNG fueling volume, and general corporate\r\npurposes.*.   \n\n\nIf you believe in the company and its business model you will likely come to the conclusion that 5% share dilusion might make sense when 100M can be invested and increase the value of the company by more than 100M. In contrary to other stocks the raised money will likely not be used to avoid bankruptcy but to build further income streams.\n\n\n\n**2. Total Marketing Service selling shares:**\nTotal, one of the partnerships of CLNE has more than 46M shares of CLNE that they are able to sell and a total voting power of more than 64M shares. According to the SEC filing they will sell some of those shares from time to time. On the 3rd and 4th of June they sold a total of 538T shares representing 0,0025% of the total shares of CLNE.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEveryone should draw his or her own conclusions from the above mentioned facts. I hope I could give all of you apes a clearer picture what CLNE and the news from yesterday in depth are.\n\nOwn positions:\n900 shares @ 9,80$\n\nThis is no financial advice.", "votes": 168, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5994, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9921, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 12:32:08", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 12:06:53", "reddit_post_id": "nv2z8i"}, "305": {"post_id": 14598, "author_id": 609638, "post_title": "Moo Moo Meadows - Home of the $CLNE cows", "self_text": "", "votes": 194, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 12:53:07", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 12:06:55", "reddit_post_id": "nv3cjj"}, "306": {"post_id": 14599, "author_id": 611942, "post_title": "Girlfriend and I Yolo\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6d into PLTR last week...told her I needed help buying the ring \u00ad\u0192\u00d1\u2524\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00d6", "self_text": "", "votes": 113, "post_title_sentiment": 0.4019, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 11:48:04", "date_pulled": "2021-06-08 12:06:56", "reddit_post_id": "nv27ay"}, "307": {"post_id": 14600, "author_id": 611946, "post_title": "Law firm attacking SPCE has short position in It.

Shareholder meeting on Wednesday, and Souki has released huge news the last 2 Thursdays in a row.\n\nJust in the interest of transparency, my TD account is a \"Pooled Asset Vehicle\" and I am part owner of a Private Equity Fund called \"White Buffalo Group.\" We consist of 3 owners, and 2 additional private investors. The goal is $500k in equity inside of 3 years, at which point we will roll a portion (or leverage the account with a LOC) into commercial real-estate.\n\nI took some heat on one of my last post for saying \"we\" anticipate various price targets, well that is why. \"We\" maintain a network of investors in our periphery who are all extremely bullish on TELL.\n\nWe have taken a few risks with the portfolio since it was opened in late January, were up and down BIG on GME during its initial run, were able to exit that position with a $13k gain, but have taken a few hits since then. TELL is ultimately what salvaged the portfolio and it was purely by chance we even fell into it. TELL is still widely unknown and is just now gaining some traction in the news.\n\nEverything I see and research on TELL is fantastic, it is almost a \"too good to be true\" position. This is 100% a retirement level stock. If you get in heavy and early, and have the patience to wait it out, this stock will make you wealthy. I think the short term potential is huge but the long term is enormous. Even with an entry point in the $5's, you are still looking at 100% gains inside of a month or two based on the deals that have been announced/will be announced, mixed with the fact that TELL was trading in the $8's, pre-covid, with no deals and debt.\n\nTake this advice at your own risk, I think we are about to see some wild shit from TELL in the next 2 weeks. Check out Souki's coffee talk video on YT last week, he even said to \"be ready for the ride of a lifetime.\" This dude is no joke, a few years ago he was one of the highest paid CEO's in the world. He left a thriving LNG company that he essentially built into what it is today to pursue Tellurian. This guy does not miss, and at these levels, TELL is a no brainer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been struggling to have post make it past the auto-mod, but I thought I would contribute to the sub with something other than GME, BB, and AMC for those looking for the next big thing.

Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again.  Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money.  (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded).  Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:\n\n\n\n**CLNE.**\n\n\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked.  But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.  \n\n\n\n**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?** \n\n\n\nWell, it's the only one with the government on our side.  Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles?  This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call \"Renewable Natural Gas\" (RNG).  \n\n\n\n**So how the fuck are they doing this??**\n\n\n\nLet me explain.  The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us.  But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative.  And who eats this shit up??  Amazon.  Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses.  Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.  \n\n\n[Source](https://investors.cleanenergyfuels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clean-energy-signs-agreement-amazon-low-and-negative-carbon-rng)  \n\n\n\n**Price**\n\n\n\nThe stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being.  I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that.  Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00  \n\n\n[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)\n\n\n\nIt's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate.  The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short.  That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.  \n\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f](https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f)\n\n\n\n**The Play?**\n\n\n\nShares.  The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely.  And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR:**  Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.  Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.  \n\n\n\n**Positions:** \n\n10x 13C 6/18\n\n100 shares @ 8.73", "votes": 1476, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9963, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 15:12:47", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:03:24", "reddit_post_id": "nv698g"}, "367": {"post_id": 14660, "author_id": 603524, "post_title": "$BB \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 I LIKE THE STOCK \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 ANYTHING BELOW $50 IS BUYING THE DIP \u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u00c6", "self_text": "", "votes": 1369, "post_title_sentiment": 0.4995, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 14:08:33", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:03:35", "reddit_post_id": "nv4uro"}, "368": {"post_id": 14661, "author_id": 612923, "post_title": "GME to the moon\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 1145, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 14:20:00", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:03:57", "reddit_post_id": "nv541a"}, "369": {"post_id": 14662, "author_id": 605669, "post_title": "They took this down because they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t want $CLNE to shine CLNE APES RISE", "self_text": "", "votes": 1220, "post_title_sentiment": 0.0772, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 18:57:07", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:04:08", "reddit_post_id": "nvbhf0"}, "370": {"post_id": 14663, "author_id": 353322, "post_title": "WISH is more than a short squeeze", "self_text": "Sure SI is high, possible gamma/short squeeze, etc etc. That's all documented in other posts. I want to talk about some other information on this stock. If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nEarning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing\n\nP/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)\n\n**numbers from the latest** [8-k](https://sec.report/Document/0001157523-21-000651/) **and** [10-q](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-027024/)**:**\n\nRevenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending \\~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.\n\nOne of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example [WISH recently partner with the south african postal services](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/global-online-store-wish-has-struck-a-deal-with-the-sa-post-office-to-deliver-products-faster-2021-4), indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.\n\n**Balance book:**\n\nWISH has $1.6B cash. \\~$2B total assets, \\~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity. \n\n**Insider selling:**\n\nAnother concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.\n\n**Technicals:**\n\nAgain, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nFrom a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of \\~1, and that would be absurd.", "votes": 970, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5319, "self_text_sentiment": 0.997, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 19:15:43", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:04:51", "reddit_post_id": "nvbws4"}, "371": {"post_id": 14664, "author_id": 612986, "post_title": "BB - Possible Rise tomorrow", "self_text": "BlackBerry will be having investor conference starting 11:25am et (June 9th 2021) which probably inflate the stock market, Keep the look out because this can certainly rocket BB to the moon.\n\nEdit: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-investor-conference-301302409.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-investor-conference-301302409.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOfficial BB Site: [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors) \n\nEdit 2: Thanks for awards first time I've been given awards on reddit pretty cool/ \n\nPls share your thoughts in comments I am scrolling around to see what you think about all that has gone on.", "votes": 831, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9432, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 20:08:39", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:13", "reddit_post_id": "nvd3t9"}, "372": {"post_id": 14665, "author_id": 599589, "post_title": "$WISH it to the MOON!", "self_text": "", "votes": 713, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 16:54:58", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:21", "reddit_post_id": "nv8r2u"}, "373": {"post_id": 14666, "author_id": 12163, "post_title": "Remember: Nothing has changed about CLNE", "self_text": "None of these factors have changed about CLNE overnight:\n\n1.

Short sellers have their fingers on the panic button and are bailing out at any threat of a rabid pack of retards stomping around, pounding their chests, talking shit, and smashing their ill-gotten gains onto the backs juicy meme tickers. And, yet, the shorts do not fear the originators of such apeish behavior: Pro Wrestlers.\n\n# How I found WWE\n\nLet me introduce to you my patented SMELL system. The acronym is reverse engineered to make sense for this ticker and so it might seem like I was piledrived as a child, but bear with me. It's important to put memes first. Here it goes:\n\n* **S**hort Interest is high\n* **M**arket cap is high\n* **E**xtremely Memeable\n* **L**ow IV\n* **L**ow Float\n\nBasically, I sniffed around for stocks that would benefit the most from even a tiny amount of short covering. Probably the most important thing here is Low IV. That means the stock has to go up less for me to profit and later expirations are cheap (because I can't time wtf you guys are doing). But it also means if the ticker catches fire the IV will spike up, further resulting in massive profit.\n\nI was quite surprised that WWE came up high on my list. As I dug into it, I was expecting that the SMELL was from sweaty redneck chads wearing spandex, surrounded by thousands of teens in Iron Maiden t-shirts who have yet to discover deodorant -- but it turns out the odor was instead the smell of bears pissing themselves.\n\n\n# I: Fundamentals\n\nI don't know anything about books of companies. You're asking the wrong guy.\n\nHowever, [this guy on SA](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4416217-wwe-powerful-sports-entertainment-franchise), and many others, seem quite excited about WWE. Perhaps as children WWE superstars provided some semblance of a father figure to them. Or, perhaps, they enjoy having their homoerotic fantasies fulfilled while writing about stocks. Either way, they did all the work. So go read their stuff and you'll find WWE is solid, possibly Rock solid.\n\nFor those even lazier than myself, here are the cliff notes:\n\n* They are effectively a monopoly on pro wrestling, which is apparently growing in popularity\n* They make money from [Media, Live Events, and Consumer Products](https://imgur.com/HFAUWJl).\n* COVID wasn't too bad for them. It cut Live Events, but [Media revenue popped up](https://imgur.com/IplD7p8).\n* Live Events are coming back... and they're taking it international. This will significantly boost their revenues, especially since during COVID it was zero.\n* Strong social media following (more YouTube subs than NBA, NFL, and GME combined). More IG followers than NFL.\n* PT of $75/sh from [some fancy FCF model thing](https://imgur.com/2lqYlSE)\n* Lots of aquisition suitors\n\n\n# II: Catalysts\n\nI'd be kidding myself if I thought you guys cared about catalysts, or that they even matter right now, but here are two big ones anyway.\n\n**Live Events Resuming**\n\nWWE will resume touring. Despite this revenue being missing in 2020, they managed to haul in nearly a billion dollars. So the second half this year, and all of next year, is going to be pretty good. Not only will revenues be driven up, but fan engagement and brand appeal will go up as well. WWE's IP has a ton of value and they've leveraged it well during COVID.. as live events come back and increase engagement, it should provide some synergy to everything else they sell -- PPV, IP rights, merchandise, etc. That's just my opinion, so please do not let the excitement of the return of live events distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.\n\n**Video Games are booming**\n\nWWE Supercard is Take Two Interactive's (a $52b company) highest grossing mobile game, and it's growing at around 23% YOY. A lot of that money will flow into WWE. WWE also sells rights to other titles. As video games continue to grow, so to does WWEs revenue.\n\n**Rumors of acquisition**\n\nAbout a week ago, WWE cut some talent assets. Some apparently important guy tweeted that it's likely due to them cutting costs and preparing for an acquisition. [Here are Reddit wrestler fans discussing this (1200 comments)](https://old.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/nqovvd/former_writer_dave_schilling_ummm_i_think_wwe_is/)\n\nRumors aside, there is a strong case for WWE being acquired, should McMahon decide to sell. From the SA article:\n\n> It is not unrealistic to suggest that WWE could one day be acquired. If McMahon indicated an interest to sell the business, there would be no shortage of potential suitors given the scarcity value of its content. Whilst Disney, Fox and Viacom could be prospective interested parties, arguably top of the list is Comcast, who may decide owning WWE may generate more value to its shareholders than perpetually leasing its content.\n\n# III: Technicals\n\nThis is closer to my specialty, and it's why WWE is my new favorite squeeze play.\n\n**High SI**: [Exchange reported SI around 8m shares](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/WWE/short-interest/) as reported May 14. Ortex shows this number has held steady even throughout this squeeze cycle. I'm imaging the shorts are trying to slowly cover to keep this under the radar, but can't help but push the stock up little by little. While the SI % Float appears to be 18%, there's more to it than that...\n\n**Low Float**: The float on this is around 44m shares. However, the company is hedging it's convertible notes (representing about 8m shares if converted) via ISDA OTC contracts with 3 banks: [JPM](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex102.htm), [MS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex104.htm), and [Citi](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex106.htm). Basically, these banks sold $38m of options, at a strike of $24.91. These are *deep ITM* options, that are pretty much fully delta hedged. **So if these banks were doing their jobs and deltahedging, that's 8m shares of commons they hold, locked up. That takes the float down to 36m shares.**\n\n**Low Volume**: The volume of this ticker is insanely low. So, there's not a huge market of interested parties looking to buy/sell shares. That basically means as shorts cover the price will move up more. Higher days-to-cover, and higher impact of gamma ramps, which I'll get to later.\n\n**Low IV**: To top it off, the options on this thing are cheap as well. I'm holding LEAPs and some July's in the hope that if there's any kind of squeeze, the IV will pop up substantially. That's where the real gains are in these squeeze plays... getting in before the IV pops. CLNE had a similar situation, but it's IV was originally around 80, not 40. It popped up 3%, but the options values went up 10-20x overnight primarily from the IV jump. It's insane to me IV is this low on WWE.\n\n**Pressure on the shorts**: The stock is at levels last seen in Dec 2019, so anybody shorting it after then is red. The average age of SI, [according to Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/8Wbox.png), is 102 days. It's pretty safe to say the majority of shorts are already underwater at this point.\n\nSo, putting it all together:  SI % Float appears as 18%, but it's really closer to 22%. That's good enough for me because: the volume is low, the shorts are in the red, and it's squeezing season. Most importantly, the IV for this is priced as though it's some boomer stock.\n\nWith IVs this low, it doesn't take much for options to print bigly. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), aka elasticity, of options is huge. Omega measures how much the option value moves with respect to the underlying. For example, with July 16 $65C, If WWE goes up .1%, option value goes up 1.6% (~16x). That's because IV is so low. I'll happily take those odds.\n\n# IV: DeltaFlux Table (gamma/charm/vanna)\n\n[DeltaFlux Tables Explained](https://old.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/ms7z36/deltaflux_tables_explained/)\n\n**OI as of:** Tue Jun 8 (at open) - **Date used for DTE**: Tue Jun 8, 2021 15:09 EST  \n**Weighted Avg IV:** 40.36%, **Shares:** 45,260,000, **Float:** 44,740,000, **Avg Vol (10d):** 880,220  \n\nPrice Point|# Shares DeltaHedged|\u00d4\u00e5\u00c9 % Float|1% Price \u00d4\u00ea\u00e5flux (sh)|\u00d4\u00e5\u00c9 % Float / % Avg Vol|24hr \u00d4\u00ea\u00e5flux (sh)|\u00d4\u00e5\u00c9 % Float / % Vol|10% IV \u00d4\u00ea\u00e5flux (sh)|\u00d4\u00e5\u00c9 % Float / % Vol\n--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\n$40.00|6,920,224|15.47|40,845|0.11 / 4.64|-1,233|0.00 / -0.14|-46,516|-0.10 / -5.28\n$42.50|7,169,011|16.02|41,289|0.11 / 4.69|-1,307|0.00 / -0.15|-51,266|-0.11 / -5.82\n$45.00|7,406,796|16.56|41,942|0.11 / 4.76|-1,270|0.00 / -0.14|-54,892|-0.12 / -6.24\n$47.50|7,635,904|17.07|42,936|0.12 / 4.88|-1,415|0.00 / -0.16|-57,083|-0.13 / -6.49\n$50.00|7,861,215|17.57|45,256|0.12 / 5.14|-2,088|0.00 / -0.24|-57,647|-0.13 / -6.55\n$52.50|8,091,075|18.08|49,105|0.13 / 5.58|-2,524|-0.01 / -0.29|-58,677|-0.13 / -6.67\n$55.00|8,326,671|18.61|51,674|0.14 / 5.87|-1,531|0.00 / -0.17|-62,635|-0.14 / -7.12\n**o - $56.54**|8,469,388|18.93|51,425|0.14 / 5.84|-607|0.00 / -0.07|-65,782|-0.15 / -7.47\n$57.50|8,555,344|19.12|50,592|0.14 / 5.75|-121|0.00 / -0.01|-67,591|-0.15 / -7.68\n**c - $57.86**|8,586,795|19.19|50,173|0.14 / 5.70|34|0.00 / 0.00|-68,215|-0.15 / -7.75\n$60.00|8,763,441|19.59|46,894|0.13 / 5.33|714|0.00 / 0.08|-71,266|-0.16 / -8.10\n$62.50|8,945,526|19.99|42,202|0.12 / 4.79|1,200|0.00 / 0.14|-73,525|-0.16 / -8.35\n$65.00|9,101,538|20.34|37,351|0.10 / 4.24|1,390|0.00 / 0.16|-74,281|-0.17 / -8.44\n$67.50|9,233,926|20.64|32,877|0.09 / 3.74|1,327|0.00 / 0.15|-73,659|-0.16 / -8.37\n$70.00|9,346,324|20.89|29,025|0.08 / 3.30|1,176|0.00 / 0.13|-72,150|-0.16 / -8.20\n$72.50|9,442,340|21.10|25,778|0.07 / 2.93|1,035|0.00 / 0.12|-70,168|-0.16 / -7.97\n$75.00|9,524,960|21.29|23,023|0.07 / 2.62|946|0.00 / 0.11|-67,957|-0.15 / -7.72\n$77.50|9,596,458|21.45|20,627|0.06 / 2.34|919|0.00 / 0.10|-65,620|-0.15 / -7.45\n$80.00|9,658,500|21.59|18,482|0.05 / 2.10|936|0.00 / 0.11|-63,159|-0.14 / -7.18\n$82.50|9,712,319|21.71|16,517|0.05 / 1.88|969|0.00 / 0.11|-60,530|-0.14 / -6.88\n\n% Float per % underlying change values of >0.30%+ get me excited, and we're only at 0.14%. However, I'm a little bitch and have high standards. 0.14% float deltahedged per 1% price move is still significant. For reference, right now, CLNE is at these numbers. Most tickers are well below that (around 0.05%).\n\nI wouldn't say there's any significant gamma going on here, yet. The options chain is pretty scare, aside from the gazillion options held by those banks (which are considered in this chain). You can see 20% of float deltahedged -- that's primarily from those options.\n\nWhat really gets me excited is the % Volume numbers. The gamma ramp is much stronger in that regard -- if you believe volume is more indicative of lower liquidity than float, then 4.00%+ are sizeable numbers. Put in English, if the stock moves up 1%, then 5.75% of the daily volume will need to be purchased as a deltahedge (assuming all options written are deltahedged). To me, that's significant, and can help multiply any upward movement.\n\nThe best part? The chain is rather scarce. Throw on a few thousand $60/$65 calls into the OI, and the ramp will extend out and become stronger.\n\n# V: Conclusion\n\nIf you want a low-risk, high-reward play on squeeze season, this is my pick. It's got everything, and the options are dirt cheap. On today's 3% move, even my Jan leaps printed 12%. My FDs are up 30-60%.. and I think this is only the beginning.\n\nIf you want to play the company on fundamentals, but still have some exposure to a squeeze event, you cannot go wrong with Jan LEAPs. Stay ATM or just tad OTM (if you want to collect on IVs going up).\n\nIf you've made it this far, you now know what the stock is cooking: It's tendies, you retard.", "votes": 556, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9994, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 20:02:41", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:39", "reddit_post_id": "nvcyxf"}, "380": {"post_id": 14673, "author_id": 563377, "post_title": "Our Four Leaf $CLOV \u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7", "self_text": "Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.\n\nWelcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes \u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas \u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00ee. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00bc in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.\n\n**The main topic and example today is $CLOV.** You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).\n\n$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?\n\n**Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?** Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.\n\n**What is the perfect recipe?** Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)\n\n**Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?** No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn't as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.\n\n**What will the price hit? When do I sell?** Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.\n\n**Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?** It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally, I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.\n\nTo all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.\n\nApes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. \u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. \u00ad\u0192\u00e6\u00ec\n\nAMA \u00ad\u0192\u00f9\u00fa\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nEdit: On June 18th many options contracts expire.

Hmm....\n\n**$300M Share Buyback**\n\nMay Q1 Earnings Quote: \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3As you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of   $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I   always\u252c\u00e1explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we\u252c\u00e1concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And\u252c\u00e1quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8\n\n**Dividend**\n\nRemember, \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3It costs nothing for me to hold, but it costs them to short?\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 Well on this one, you actually *get paid to hold*. **4.5% per year** at the current price. And would you look at that, we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve got a quarterly dividend ex-date coming up on June 9th, $0.10/share.\n\n**Insider buying**\n\nOne insider, Robert Verdun (director), dropped half a million on shares at  $7.87. Insiders sell for many reasons, but there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s only one reason they buy. And we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re not far above his purchase price right now. The CEO, Mat Ishbia, has committed to not selling his shares anytime in the near future as well.\n\n**Earnings**\n\nExpected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nUWM\u00a4\u2563 has 20.5% short interest, insane growth compared to peers, 4.5% dividend, great financials, low IV (for now).

Stock got shorted down from $15 to $7.60 and the puts printed. They then averaged out their high bought shares. Shares increased from less than 100k shares to over 1million shares (times 2) for two examples mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why part 2? Information that came to light:**\n\nSo on Finviz the last short interest reported was at 8% of the float.\n\nRecently Bloomies terminal updated and now the SI is at 48% of float.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vff1du0hm2471.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f090821f5da533403f6410d8d7341cc0a8e96d27\n\nVery critical in confirming the reasoning behind how the price got pushed down from $15 to $7.60 and a ton of puts were bought before the drive down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trading volume:**\n\nThe average trading volume for WISH is at about 5million, for the past two days we are seeing record highs of 50million in volume back to back. This is an indication that the floor has been met and there is absorption going on. The $7.90/$8 has rejected and Wish is now pointed upwards at the short sellers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price Targeting?:**\n\nThis is only a run up and since the shorts opened at $15 there is time for them to close with little to no losses espcially since the run up has been small. Given that the price dropped from $12 to $10 previously and the price today hit $9, the shorts who opened at $10 will start the covering. If the short squeeze from $10 rolls over, I do not believe $15 is the next level, it would be at $21. Reason being the past two absorption levels were at $20-$21.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4l6i24kyn2471.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=85d303c32b3061b9673d4c3d87eae899aaf20188\n\nEdit\\* Added float information\n\n**Float vs Shares Outstanding:**\n\nSo the shares outstanding for Wish is around 600m but the last time the public float was reported at 300m. Today in the Bloomies update the public float is at 60m. With the float size decreased by so much WISH is super volatile, the price action might even break my $21 thesis since many less shares are exchanged and a short covering would require half the float to be traded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit\\* the original tradeable float was 600mm-120mm lock up = 480mm\n\nThe current trading float is 60mm after the shrinkage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Float Shrinkage:**\n\nWith a ton of institutional investors the float shrink probably means something was at work and the price was pushed down so shares can be bought up by someone else. Basically a buyback without shrinking the total number of shares in the market.\n\nThe plan to bring the price down to do the shady exchange have been caught with the pants down. Right now the pants are down and the exchange of shares is happening for control of the company. The shorts need to be covered and the float will need to hit shares outstanding again.\n\n>! Possible price target $100. The normal float if 480mm shares exchanged in a day during a squeeze.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Verdict:** >!The rocket is in motion.  \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 and I like this stock!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# MODS ASKED ME TO PUT PARTS TOGTHER!\n\n# PART 3 BELOW (PUZZLE COMPLETED)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe I need to post part 3 separately since it's a whole other story.\n\nNote: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice\n\nI bring you part 3, the innerworkings of an under the table transaction.\n\n>!The Art of the Deal!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**p1:** Shares shorted, puts bought, shares held gone up to ATH by hedgefunds\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish\\_institutional\\_share\\_increase\\_with\\_open\\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish_institutional_share_increase_with_open_puts/)\n\n**p2:** Bloomies updated, SI went from 8% to 48%, tradable float down from 300m to 60m\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8sfe/wish\\_dd\\_part\\_2\\_more\\_pieces\\_of\\_puzzle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8sfe/wish_dd_part_2_more_pieces_of_puzzle/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy is Part 3 coming in so fast? **The puzzle might be solved and the pants are down.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStrange how the tradable float can go from 300m to 60m and institutional investors at 98%.\n\n>!This only means one thing, something shady is going on!<.\n\nPiecing the pieces together, the float shrinkage is due to shorting and an artificial buyback without actually reducing shares. The thesis is that there is a takeover of WISH shares and the prices was driven down with puts and shorts so the shares can be exchanged at lower price. The results of the shorting and exchange created a low float and now as the exchange is happening.\n\nRight now, the stonk dealers got caught with their pants down mid exchange and the shorts need to be covered and the transaction completed at a higher cost basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The covering:**\n\nEdit\\* With such a low float of 1/8\\* the actual real float this WISH squeeze might be yuge.\n\nLow float  \u00d4\u00a3\u00f6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nHigh volatility  \u00d4\u00a3\u00f6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nHigh Shorts  \u00d4\u00a3\u00f6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nBottomed  \u00d4\u00a3\u00f6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nPants still down?  \u00d4\u00a3\u00f6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nI like this stock \u00d4\u00a3\u00f6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nCHECKMATE BETCH   [\u00d4\u00d6\u0192\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5](https://emojipedia.org/chess-pawn/) >!(I am no simple pawn, but there are many, thousands, millions of me)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSTOP ROBBING PETER>!(US SHAREHOLDERS)!< TO PAY PAUL( \u00ad\u0192\u00f1\u00ed )!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrab shares and make your wish, aim for the moon and land on the stars.\n\nAPES!\n\n&#x200B;", "votes": 423, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5319, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9971, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 16:56:44", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:47", "reddit_post_id": "nv8sfe"}, "386": {"post_id": 14679, "author_id": 613117, "post_title": "#WISH me away to the #moon!!", "self_text": "", "votes": 396, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 17:09:45", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:49", "reddit_post_id": "nv9383"}, "387": {"post_id": 14680, "author_id": 613194, "post_title": "$Wish me luck \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 384, "post_title_sentiment": 0.4588, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 16:21:31", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:51", "reddit_post_id": "nv7z3f"}, "388": {"post_id": 14681, "author_id": 547738, "post_title": "$WISH another YOLO", "self_text": "", "votes": 388, "post_title_sentiment": 0.4278, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 16:28:06", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:05:52", "reddit_post_id": "nv84n1"}, "389": {"post_id": 14682, "author_id": 606126, "post_title": "WISH?

Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.\n2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.\n3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.\n4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.\n5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?\n6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.\n7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.\n8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.\n9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:\n10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.\n11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter & Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.\n12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.\n13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.\n14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.\n15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.\n16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.\n17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.\n18. There are 8\\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \\*Cowen & Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.\n19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.\n20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.\n21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.\n\nIt's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.\n\nSo, how to deal with fear?\n\n1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.\n2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.\n3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!\n\nAlso, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.\n\nTLDR\n\n1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.\n2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.\n3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.\n4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.\n5.

No. Well, that may be because you're not one of the brainless zombies scrolling through social media 16 hours a day. WISH targets ads towards this audience in hopes they will download the Wish app, once inside the app, they get access to your Facebook account to get key statistics about you.

Negative user growth last quarter.** This is now starting to rebound with the country opening back up, because $WISH's biggest demographic is lower income individuals. Jobs are opening up again, expect a big rebound.\n\n**2.)

The amount of the credit would vary depending on the lifecycle carbon emissions of the given fuel. Generally, for transportation fuel sold before January 1, 2030, the credit would equal the product of (1) $1.00 per gallon of transportation fuel produced and sold by the taxpayer (as adjusted for inflation) and (2) the emissions factor for such fuel (that is, an amount equal to the quotient of (A) an amount equal to the baseline emissions rate, minus the emissions rate for such fuel, divided by (B) the baseline emissions rate). To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must be produced at a qualified facility and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person (1) for use by such person in the production of a fuel mixture, (2) for use by such person in a trade or business, or (3) who sells such fuel at retail into the fuel tank of another person. The credit would be subject to phase-out if the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods annually in the United States are determined to be equal to or less than 25 percent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods in the United States for calendar year 2021.*\n* ***Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit****. Section 30C(a) provides a credit of 30 percent of the cost of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year, subject to a credit cap. The key changes in the bill would be to increase the Section 30C credit cap from $30,000 to $200,000, in the case of qualified property that is depreciable property, and to expand the definition of qualifying fuels to consist of hydrogen and any transportation fuel for which the Clean Fuel Production Credit is allowed.

This looks like the first day of crazy volatility, and i expect this to continue until after the last day when the stock price jumps the most(when retail investors cover) now let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s get into the data, to show why this is actually a even better setup then AMC for a retail short squeeze\nDisclaimer: no where in this post am I saying hedge funds have covered in AMC yet, so you die hard apes don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t need to spam me with hate comments.\nNow let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s get into it. \n\nIf you go over to fintel you will see volume today was 700 MILLION. Yes you heard that correctly, CLOV, which has a 112 million share float, had on average every share traded 7 TIMES IN ONE F*CKING DAY. For reference, AMC in it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s glory days had like 800 million in volume with a 500 million float. Now there are multiple explanations to why there was so much volume, 1. Is a bunch of day traders and machines  came in to make a quick profit, on top\nof all the apes scooping their shares right up to own the float. \nOr 2. Hedge funds with synthetic shares, which is most likely. Today alone there was 200 million shares sold short, while fintel was showing 0 shares available all day. How the hell is 200 million shares shorted possible with 0 shares available? Now keep in mind that most of these synthetics would have been bought right back by a machine after no less then a second to make a .1 percent return on them, because if they just sold 200 million shares at a time to the open market the price would be at 2 dollars right now, but it still shows the manipulation and the desperation from them to keep the stock price suppressed. \n\nEither way all the volume on top of the synthetics show how much new apes are coming in and buying up the float, there has been 0 or close to 0 shares available to borrow for a day or two now, meaning retail can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t actually double down on their short positions or open new ones, which also means with continued losses they will be forced to cover since they can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t average up. \n\nNow If we go over to ortex, or ortex\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s twitter, we can see that CLOV currently has 51 million shares that are borrowed and waiting to be returned.  That is 45 percent of the float. A 45 percent short interest compared to AMC before retail covered was around 30 percent. With just a 4th of the buying power compared to AMC, our short squeeze can take us to 100 easily(our float is a 4th of AMC\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s). If we can achieve the same kind of cult following that AMC got, we are looking at a GME TYPE OF RUN! \nAnd for the love of all that is holy, guys please wait to buy until 8:30 AM eastern so I can pick up shares before it goes to 50, appreciate it \u00ad\u0192\u00ff\u00ff.", "votes": 279, "post_title_sentiment": 0.3612, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9768, "date_posted": "2021-06-09 02:10:52", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:07:33", "reddit_post_id": "nvkr22"}, "474": {"post_id": 14767, "author_id": 613585, "post_title": "25K Yolo on $WISH see yall on the moon tomorrow \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 135, "post_title_sentiment": 0.2732, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-09 00:49:37", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:07:36", "reddit_post_id": "nvj9iu"}, "475": {"post_id": 14768, "author_id": 596886, "post_title": "I really WISH this could triple tomorrow.", "self_text": "", "votes": 121, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5756, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 21:35:21", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:07:37", "reddit_post_id": "nvf73b"}, "476": {"post_id": 14769, "author_id": 607559, "post_title": "THANK YOU, WSB!!! $290 to $8000 today.", "self_text": "", "votes": 118, "post_title_sentiment": 0.626, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 22:07:48", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:07:37", "reddit_post_id": "nvfz83"}, "477": {"post_id": 14770, "author_id": 613590, "post_title": "Took my CLOV profit and rolled it to CLNE!", "self_text": "", "votes": 131, "post_title_sentiment": 0.4926, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-08 22:03:24", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 00:07:38", "reddit_post_id": "nvfvdp"}, "478": {"post_id": 14771, "author_id": 598479, "post_title": "CLOV, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6M NOT FU**ING SELLING!

The question really is, how long can TLRY stay green and maintain momentum? At this point it's not a matter of if shorts cover, but WHEN will shorts cover? This high short interest is unjustified as Tilray has announced very bullish fundamental news including: new product line, recent reverse merger with Aphria, and strong regulatory statements on medical cannabis. My price target for the short term is: $120.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 month chart of TLRY looks beautiful:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na8hxacjw4471.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=86be7d0d201ab0e30cc1153edfdd74618f6e9040\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe the key here is consistent volume + eating up the ask for a big win for WSB.

Still large volume today and yesterday means that the \\~$15-16 USD range is going to act as a strong base for us going forward.  \n200DMA moving upwards, Bollinger Bands slightly still expanding, looks bullish. \n\nThe hourly chart will paint us a better picture for our baseline.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yk78c534e6471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31b4e32c5bd961cdfd1b9f7813cd60e8c965d62\n\nMASSIVE wall at 14.50, just as I've been strongly stating throughout this run.

(By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded). Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:\n\n**CLNE.**\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked. But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.\n\n**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?**\n\nWell, it's the only one with the government on our side. Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles? This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call \"Renewable Natural Gas\" (RNG).\n\n**So how the fuck are they doing this??**\n\nLet me explain. The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us. But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative. And who eats this shit up?? Amazon. Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses. Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.\n\n[Source](https://investors.cleanenergyfuels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clean-energy-signs-agreement-amazon-low-and-negative-carbon-rng)\n\n**Price**\n\nThe stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being. I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that. Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10. The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00\n\n[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)\n\nIt's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate. The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short. That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f](https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f)\n\n**The Play?**\n\nShares. The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely. And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.\n\n**TL;DR:** Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.

Clean Energy has participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for over 20 years and will argue they are the largest U.S. provider of renewable natural gas for commercial transportation. Clean Energy is in a unique position because valuable Environmental Credits are generated by the party that dispenses renewable natural gas into vehicle fuel tanks, and they have access to more dispensers than any other market participant.\n\nAs a comprehensive clean energy solutions provider, Clean Energy:\n\n* designs and builds, as well as operates and maintains, public and private vehicle fleet customer stations in the United States and Canada\n* sells and services compressors and other equipment used in renewable natural gas production and at fueling stations\n* transports and sells their fuels via \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3virtual\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 natural gas pipelines and interconnects\n* sells U.S. federal, state and local government credits, which they collectively refer to as Environmental Credits, they generate by selling renewable natural gas as a vehicle fuel\n* obtains federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives\n\nOn April 19, 2021, Clean Energy announced an [agreement with Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-agreement-with-amazon-for-low-and-negative-carbon-rng-01618826728?tesla=y) to provide low and negative carbon RNG. Fuel will be provided at 27 existing Clean Energy fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations by the end of the year. This will provide renewable natural gas in 15 different states. Additionally, on May 11, 2021, Chevron announced they were investing an additional $20M in the [Adopt-a-Port initiative](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-clean-energy-fuels-extend-adopt-a-port-initiative-to-reduce-emissions-01620727503?tesla=y) with Clean Energy to provide cleaner, more carbon-negative renewable natural gas.\n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nClean Energy began to see the negative effects of COVID-19 on volumes delivered in mid-March 2020 and continued to see declines in volumes delivered through December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. Their volumes bottomed in the second quarter of 2020 and improved through year-end albeit at a slower pace than expected, with volumes delivered for the fourth quarter of 2020 increasing 7% over the second quarter of 2020. While volumes delivered in December 2020 were 2% lower compared to December 2019, this decline was lower than the decline of 4% when comparing September 2020 to September 2019. The most significant negative effects of COVID-19 in relation to Clean Energy volumes were experienced in the airports (fleet services) and public transit customer markets, which were down by between 15% and 31% during 2020 compared to 2019 due to federal, state and local government mandates to restrict normal daily activities, as well as travel bans, quarantines and \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3shelter-in-place\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 orders.\n\nOther risk factors Clean Energy may face include:\n\n* The willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt Clean Energy vehicle fuels, which may be influenced by certain of the factors, many of which are beyond their control.\n* Competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally, and the nature and effect of competitive developments in the market\n* Suppliers\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 ability to successfully develop and operate projects and produce expected volumes of renewable natural gas, particularly in light of a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments\n* The potential commercial viability of livestock waste and dairy farm projects to produce renewable natural gas\n* The development and production of vehicles and engines in key customer and geographic markets by vehicle and engine manufacturers, over which Clean Energy has no control\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n[According to Simplywall.st](https://preview.redd.it/bwl9boec16471.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad876df7da5412f5496a49e1d2e8bea321680254)\n\nI am bullish on Clean Energy and I agree they are currently undervalued. Clean Energy serves fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users, and government fleets.

In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**\n\n6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few months with fundraising, and increased profits in 2021.\n\n7.) They will not go bankrupt. They have made it through this pandemic, and the light at the end of the tunnel is near.\n\n8.) It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.\n\n9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations, grow the business, and pay debt, using runway from stock sales. AMC just did this yesterday, and they can do it again if needed. Adam Aron is capitalizing on the situation to secure the long-term future of his company, and management is making the right decisions. **Dilution is not a bad thing.**\n\n10.) Not only has bankruptcy been averted for AMC, but [**they also raised $587 million yesterday**. They can now start growing their company and eliminating burdens.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/amc-says-it-has-already-completed-share-offering-raises-587-million.html) Most of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.\n\n11.) [AMC is about 20% shorted](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC)**, there is still good potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.\n\n12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. This year is going to be [\"the best year for movie releases in a long time\"](https://time.com/6047564/summer-movies-2021/), with big releases like *F9*, *Shang-Chi & The Legend of the 10 Rings*, *Black Widow*, *Nobody*, *A Quiet Place 2*, *Suicide Squad*, *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, *Cruella*, *Free Guy*, *Jungle Cruise*, *In The Heights*, and even more after summer. Both movies set to release in 2021 and 2020 are now releasing at the same time, so in one year there will be x2 as many movies to watch.\n\n13.) AMC is dipping right now... these are discounted prices. **If you are going to buy, do it now**. A price point this cheap will never come again.\n\n14.) GME hit $300 on a fucking squeeze. With strong fundamentals behind it as well, $AMC deserves a it's fair valuation. It's $AMC's turn.\n\n15.) AMC has actually made money in [6/10 past years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206962/net-income-of-amc-theatres/), in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, & 2018. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)\n\n*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*\n\n16.) Without AMC there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.\n\n17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.\n\n18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.\n\n19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)\n\n20.) **STONKS only go up.**\n\n21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.\n\n#22.) free popcorn\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTL;DR : CEO is raising money to secure the long-term future of AMC. They can finance operations, grow their business, & eliminate existing burdens. Vaccine rollout is advanced, and recovery is coming now. **People are returning to movies**. About 20% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.\n\nPandemic recovery & squeeze combo.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Buy AMC.

Hold on, **is that really a good thing?**\n\nNote that this is no financial advice. It only expresses basic economics.\n\n***Monetary policy - Inflation and reference rate***\n\nFor those without economic background, let me remind that high periods of inflation (above the 2% target) will trigger an increase in the reference rate in order to reduce money supply and bring back inflation to its accepted level (between 0%-2%). Without going into the details, increase in reference rate will transfer to commercial banks and, eventually, increase (variable) mortgage rates.\n\n***Current situation in the US***\n\nLooking at the time series of M2 supply, you can observe that M2 in the US is going through the roof, which has already generated a surge in inflation (4.2% in April 2021 against 0.3% in April 2020). If inflation remains at such high level, the FED will have no choice but to increase the reference rate, which will increase mortgage rates. This will affect clients with variable mortgage rate and roll-over fixed rate contracts.\n\nMichael Burry (known for The Big Short) is betting on this and has puts on T-bills. Why? because an increase in interest rate will decrease bond prices (recall the price of a bond is the Net PV of cash flows, blablabla).\n\n***Client's probability of default at loan origination***\n\nBanks (or loan providers) estimate the probability of defaults (PD), where variables are for example income/affordability because they are good measures to know if the client can repay the loan. Usually, credit officers will calculate the PD with a buffer on interest rate (high interest rate means higher monthly payments which decreases the client's creditworthiness) to give some room in case of increases in interest rate. High income/affordability means good creditworthiness ofc\n\n***Interest rate hikes, PD and demand for properties***\n\nBut what happens if inflation increases so much that reference rate is pushed very high? The risk is that the above mentioned buffer (if even existing at loan approval) will not be sufficient to absorb the hikes and clients with variable mortgage rates and roll-over loans will not be able to pay back. Contracts become junk contracts because the underlying client is defaulting.\n\nIf the general PD increases due to a major sytemic shock (e.g. significan increase in interest rate), there are two effects: a portion of clients will default and properties will be liquidated on the market, which increases the supply. Second, higher interest rate means higher rents. Hence, fewer clients will be able to afford the loans and therefore the demand for properties will decrease. More supply coupled with less demand necessarily leads to a decrease in house price index.\n\n***Summary:***\n\nLow increase in mortgage rates can be beneficial, yes. But if inflation keeps increasing at this speed and level, we can expect significant increases in reference rate. If increases are significant, some clients will defaults, others will not be able to access new loans, which will increase supply and decrease demand for properties, respectively. I am sure you get it, this situation is terrible for companies operating in mortgage business.", "votes": 144, "post_title_sentiment": 0.7096, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9964, "date_posted": "2021-06-09 01:01:01", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 12:07:39", "reddit_post_id": "nvjgk5"}, "577": {"post_id": 14870, "author_id": 581722, "post_title": "RKT Financial Statement Analysis from the mind of a CPA. My opinion on the \"Non-Controlling Interest\" line of the Income Statement and why Dan Gilbert could send this stock to the stratosphere in 3 seconds if he wanted to turn hedge funds into hobos for shorting this stock", "self_text": "Hi all, I'm back with a dive into the financial statements into what exactly this line highlighted below \"Non-Controlling Interest\" (NCI) is. and why it appears to take away so much of the Net Income before \"Net Income attributable to Rocket Companies\". In this screenshot below the amount of NCI is about 97% of Net Income. If you look at the most recent quarters the NCI is about 93%. Regardless of what it is RKT is slated to deliver 2021 EPS of around $2. Positive earnings for a company trading at a 9 P/E ratio (as of today) should be doing much better in this stock environment regardless of the NCI impact yet RKT continues to trade below it's fair value of a minimum $40 per share based on a 22 P/E ratio valuation which is the standard for S&P. Regardless of all that, what the analysts are failing to discuss is this company is INSANLY profitable and can turn way higher EPS by the snap of it's fingers by decreasing the NCI. A mere 3% decrease could triple EPS. See my next screenshot for what the NCI is.\n\n[screenshot per RKT 10k](https://preview.redd.it/oacouksut4471.png?width=1641&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0428fd23135785caeb6074397f3140762b0310)\n\nThe screenshot below describes per RKT annual 10k that RHI is a partnership owned 94% by  Dan Gilbert. This is also referred to as the class D shares that I have seen many other intelligent apes discuss. These class D shares give Dan and the C-Suite sweeping control over 70% of the voting stock giving them free rain to dictate the company as they see fit. In some cases this could be bad but in the case of RKT I see similarities to early day Amazon in the sense that 1) they are determined to take market share at whatever means necessary to win long term and 2) they actually have the ability to be insanely profitable if they choose to be but continue to reinvest the money in growing the business (i.e. their big marketing campaign we've all been seeing on TV).  Getting back to my point now on the 3%. If Dan Gilbert were to sell his shares (EDIT UPDATE) SELL HIS SHARES BACK TO THE COMPANY (i.e retire the shares decreasing shares outstanding making them treasury shares). This would then lower NCI while increasing EPS.\n\nTo summarize my two points RKT can triple their bottom line EPS by two easy ways if they wanted to 1) stop taking market share and deliver stellar earnings or 2) Dan can retire a mere 3% of his class D shares to squeeze every short out of their boxers.\n\nI personally find this very compelling case to own shares of this company as they have proven they want to continue to grow top line revenue as best they can in the mortgage space before they begin to maximize profits. If either of these two events above occur on a fundamental basis would triple the EPS and therefore even at current P/E ratio valuation of 9 would send the stock up to $60 if their P/E would drop to 3. If the stock begins trading at S&P valuation levels of 22 P/E ratio it would be around $120 per share without considering the other revenue streams growing by triple digits.\n\nBottom line: On a fundamental analysis looking at RKT it makes no sense why the stock is trading at the levels it's been at the past month. The bears are losing their only case now that the 10 year yield has fallen as you can see by the big gains these last few trading days. I appreciate all of the other analysis done on a technical level by the other apes.

This is nor surprising or a concern as CITADEL is such a large hedge fund that they have stake in MANY companies.\n\nRecently, I have seen a lot of inaccurate information being spread that CLOV is a trap set out by the hedgefunds due to CITADEL stake in CLOV but this was just debunked as they have even a larger stake in AMC.\n\n$CLOV\n\nData for CLOV from FINRA shows that on May 24, 2021, short interest was 36.11% of the float which is very high.  Data provided by ORTEX shows that short interest just this Friday was 42.58%. This  increased to 44.31% on Monday and yesterday's (Tuesday June 8) data was at 45.56% which is another INCREASE in the short interest. \n\nEven though the stock has sky rocketed in value, the SHORT INTEREST of the free float has NOT DECLINED meaning that a short squeeze has not occurred! Shorts currently are not covering their position. The recent gains in CLOV's stock price is purely from retail investors like us piling in.\n\nIf we continue to increase the share price of CLOV, then we will see a HUGE short squeeze and with the short interest of over 40%, that's going to be a very violent move and the return is going to be more that we can imagine! Considering the insane volume of 725 Million yesterday and the fact that it is the most mentioned ticker on WSB yesterday, there is definitely a lot of retail investors piling into CLOV to create a short squeeze.\n\nIf everything continues like this with the stock price increasing,  putting more pressure on the shorts, CLOV could ultimately squeeze at a much higher price!\n\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/gme/citadel-advisors-llc\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/amc/citadel-advisors-llc\nhttps://fintel.io/ss/us/clov\nhttps://twitter.com/ortex/status/1402276612905881603?s=21\nhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CLOV\nhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC", "votes": 132, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.995, "date_posted": "2021-06-09 04:47:51", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 12:07:53", "reddit_post_id": "nvnhz1"}, "587": {"post_id": 14880, "author_id": 22163, "post_title": "IT'S THE FUCKING SQUEEZE'NING SZN \u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4\u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec\u00ad\u0192\u00f1\u2593\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u255d", "self_text": "", "votes": 124, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-09 02:38:26", "date_pulled": "2021-06-09 12:07:55", "reddit_post_id": "nvl8zj"}, "588": {"post_id": 14881, "author_id": 598634, "post_title": "$CLOV Paid for my Euro Trip!

I'm starting see a familiar pattern with CLOV. I see a similar pattern with AMC's second day of rise and CLOV's behavior today. With an initial spike, both of these stocks all started with a high pre-market price and a cooldown throughout the day. Eventually, AMC showed this pattern for a day or two until it shot up for the last time before the short squeeze began. CLOV is still at an infant phase of a massive potential squeeze. The shorts are putting on pressure to keep CLOV low, but the counter pressure from retail investors are holding the stock and not give into the panic. Holding the line for a day or two will accumulate more retail investors, who are buying these dips. If CLOV is the next short squeeze play, it will surpass AMC in a heartbeat.\n\nPrediction:\n\nCLOV is a gamble play for sure. There is always a probability of short squeeze happening depending on many factors, like media and sentiment. However, CLOV was my next pick because the numbers showed me that it definitely had a massive squeeze potential, and I saw a familiar resemblance with AMC. High risk high reward.\n\nIf CLOV plays out like how AMC did, CLOV will close today with the resistance around $17\\~$18 range. The next morning, CLOV will see a massive spike during the pre-market and cooling off for a bit throughout the day. Then CLOV would've stabilized around $20 and the shorts will start to get impatient. They will have to cover their shorts because they are not seeing CLOV going down anywhere close to $7\\~8 again in the next couple of days. Thus, the short squeeze will begin. Once it begins, more retail investors will join in. With the options expiring on the 18th, more people will join in seeing a potential gamma squeeze. I can see this stock go to an unimaginable numbers if the pattern continues. \n\nThis is a domino effect play. The first step has to be completed before moving onto the next. I believe that the first step is already completed, and we are at the second step, fighting against bearish sentiment. Third step is the squeeze. Fourth step is wait for the squeeze to stabilize, and the last step is to cash out the profit.\n\nThis is purely my personal opinions and not a financial advice.

The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. \n\nThe borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.\n\n0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. \n\nYesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. \n\nThe shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC.

This year alone, the American Pet Products Association expects nearly $110 billion will be spent on companion animals, $44.1 billion of which is on food and treats, which is BarkBox's specialty.\n\nInnovation is also important for BARK.

This is very clearly a collaboration by the hedge funds to earn back their lost money from shorting GME/AMC/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**\n\n**A:**  Institutional ownership =/= shorts.\n\nInstitutions decide if they are shorting a position or holding for the long haul. CLOV isn't just a meme stock, they are a disruptor in the Medicare advantage field with promising and improving results quarter after quarter. They were added to the MSCI index in May**^(1)** and are being added to the Russell 3000 index on June 25th at market close**^(2)**.\n\nCLOV has had a high short interest for months**^(3)** driving the price down from $17 in December 2020 to bottoms of $6 making this a prime long pick for non-shorting institutions in the intermediary time between then and now. Citadel isn't even in the top ten for institutional ownership**^(4)**. Do you know who is in the top ten? Vanguard and Blackrock, both very well-known for investing in to companies most likely to be successful.\n\nNumber one in institutional CLOV holdings? Greenoaks Capital. \"***Greenoaks Capital believes a small handful of high-quality technology companies define each generation. Their mission is to identify those companies early in their life cycle and partner with them for decades.***\" **^(5)**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Q:** **Citadel owns 500,000 shares of CLOV, this must be a distraction scheme to cover their positions for AMC/GME/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**\n\n**A:** Citadel DID indeed own 500,000 shares of CLOV as of 03-31**^(6)**\u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 Citadel also happens to have been holding over 700,000 shares of AMC as of the same date**^(7)**. Citadel owns approximately 0.45% of the entire existing non-shorted float of CLOV. Shorting Institutions often hold long and short positions at the same time. This is a normal occurrence.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Q:** **Clover Health only has 4 employees according to Robinhood!

Go for it, look up their last earnings report and look at how much money they shat down the drain.\n\nThat\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s why they have short interest in excess of 20% - they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re SHIT COMPANIES.\n\nTrading them is a fucking shot in the dark - sure, it might go up based off retail buy pressure, gamma ramp, or a short getting margin called elsewhere in their account - but if it does YOU GOT LUCKY. \n\nThese are shit companies, and guess what happens if you don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t get the market mechanics you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re looking for?\n\nYou\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re bag holding a shit company.\n\nThere are literally two companies with traction on this sub that turn a profit, $UWMC and $CLF.\n\nUWMC looked good months ago, same time RKT did - only since then housing starts have dropped three months in a row, and the imminent collapse of homebuyer sentiment is dinner-table conversation in every suburb your mom has a boyfriend. Share price valuations are forward-looking, and the outlook for UWMC is not overly positive, no matter what the half-assed DD you read here said.\n\n\n**CLF has the exact opposite macro-outlook.** Steel prices have tripled in the past year, with industry overheads remaining largely stable save for the price of Iron Ore, which has also ran up significantly. Fortunately, CLF produces their own Iron Ore, **so they are literally shitting out money as they reap the benefits of vertical integration.** \n\nSteel prices are **the highest they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve ever been** - nearly every single steel company is going to report their greatest quarter in history this summer. But most importantly:\n\n**STEEL PRICES ARE GOING TO STAY HIGH.** Why?\n\n- **Chinese steel accounts for 15-20%** of the global export market, and they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve all but stopped exporting - they eliminated Tax rebate incentives for steel producers last month in a bid to keep supply grounded domestically for their own affordable infrastructure stimulus and carbon emissions goals, and have been floating rumors of an export tax the past two weeks. 15% of the worlds export tonnage drying up is HUGE - the leftover demand will NEED to come from somewhere.\n\nAdditionally, the 2022 Beijing olympics are around the corner, and who remembers what china did in an effort to combat smog prior to the 2008 games? They shuttered steel production in Beijing/Hebei, one of the largest steel producing provinces. Less Chinese steel = higher ex-China prices.\n\n- **Nations using infrastructure-as-stimulus post-covid.** Bidens infrastructure bill is coming down the pipe. China issued a $500 Billion package as well, and they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re being floated in parliaments across South America, Asia, and Europe as we speak.\n\n- **Industry consolidation.** Competition and supply gluts are what eventually kill commodity runs - but the US and European steel industries have consolidated into significantly fewer hands since the last steel bull run. The current CLF is the product of the 2020 acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA, taking two independent drivers off the table.\n\n**In addition to the boatload of macroeconomic tailwinds the steel industry writ-large is experiencing, \nthere are also CLF specific advantages.**\n\n- **GOES.** CLF is the sole American producer of Grain-Oriented Electric Steel (GOES), which is necessary for transformers, generators, and other grid elements necessary for the transition to renewables.\n\n- **Vertically Integrated.** Discussed earlier, CLF is equal parts Iron Ore Miner and Steel producer.\n\n- **High short interest.** on the order of 20%. I truly do not understand the shorts thesis AT ALL. Yes CLF is leveraged due to recent acquisitions, but they are printing money. Literally printing it.\n\n**For perspective: CLF is an $11 Billion company that is projected to do $4 Billion+ in EBITDA this year. AMC is a $25 Billion company that did $0.77 Billion EBITDA in 2019, PRE-Pandemic.**\n\nI trimmed my CLF for other steel companies over the last couple weeks and am regretting it now that WSB is finally aware of the shares on loan %.\n\nCLF\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s fair valuation relative to CURRENT industry peers based on forward EBITDA, book value, and managements forecasts on debt pay down would put CLF squarely in $30-40 / share range. That\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s not even counting continued sector growth over the coming year, that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s just **fair value right now.**\n\nFair value returns at 50%-100% even BEFORE meme/squeeze returns is a hell of a lot safer of a bet than UWMC, BB, AMC, GME, CLNE, CLOV, or whatever the hell else ill-advised prayer play I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve seen here the past week.\n\n**TLDR: CLF is pretty much the only WSB short interest play with limited fundamental downside; they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re shitting money, and have enough macroeconomic tailwinds to entertain a supply chain logistics class for a semester.**\n\n If you think it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s late for CLF you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re probably not aware of the industry landscape or the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s footing in it.\n\nEdit: \n\nPositions: \n\nCLF 10/15 18c \n\nCLF 10/15 20c\n\nAs well as Various other MT and TX September and later calls.", "votes": 1299, "post_title_sentiment": 0.1511, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9862, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 04:16:21", "date_pulled": "2021-06-10 12:02:47", "reddit_post_id": "nweryx"}, "748": {"post_id": 15042, "author_id": 590988, "post_title": "CLOV, WISH, CLF - Russian Apes on the way to help!", "self_text": "", "votes": 1071, "post_title_sentiment": 0.7525, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 09:18:00", "date_pulled": "2021-06-10 12:03:33", "reddit_post_id": "nwj86u"}, "749": {"post_id": 15043, "author_id": 616526, "post_title": "$WISH $680K YOLO \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 50k in shares + 500 options \u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec\u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec\u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec down $100K today but \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4\u00ad\u0192\u00f1\u2593\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u2557", "self_text": "", "votes": 823, "post_title_sentiment": 0.3646, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 02:59:56", "date_pulled": "2021-06-10 12:03:55", "reddit_post_id": "nwdfd2"}, "750": {"post_id": 15044, "author_id": 1069, "post_title": "Daily Discussion Thread for June 10, 2021", "self_text": "CLOV, CLNE, BB discussion can be found in the [Popular Ticker Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwjtyu/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_june_10_2021) thread!\n\n[GME Earnings Megathread - Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwjw4u/gme_q1_earnings_megathread_the_morning_after)", "votes": 925, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 10:00:14", "date_pulled": "2021-06-10 12:04:07", "reddit_post_id": "nwjtth"}, "751": {"post_id": 15045, "author_id": 511633, "post_title": "CLF - we like our steel now \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4\u00ad\u0192\u00d6\u00ee\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "U.S. is the world's most-expensive steel market, steel prices are high overseas at the moment too, discouraging buyers in the U.S. from pursuing imports.

That being said, I think its safe bet based on the name though that it has something to do with both the city of Cleveland and also (obviously) cliffs.  \n&nbsp;  \nWhile I can't tell you much about **$CLF**, I can tell you quite a bit about the city of Cleveland and the wonderful geological features known as \"cliffs\", and why I am bullish as fuck on both of those.  \n&nbsp;  \n#Fundamentals  \nI know for most of you WSB newcomers you may be used to trading on emotions and memes, but its important to look at the fundamentals as well, so before we get to the memes lets start with some fundamentals and important background information.  \n&nbsp;  \n**Cleveland:**   \n\n- Founded July 22, 1796 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland#History)) \n- Cleveland is the second largest city in the state of Ohio with a population of 381,009 ([source](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/clevelandcityohio))\n- Cleveland  had a 2019 GDP of $118.17 Billion, up ~$1.5b from 2018, and nearly $13b since 2009. ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/514232/gdp-forecast-of-the-cleveland-metro-area/))  \n- As of 2021 Cleveland has an annual budget of $1.8 billion ([source](https://www.wksu.org/government-politics/2021-03-16/cleveland-city-council-passes-1-8-billion-budget))\n&nbsp;  \n\n**Cliffs:**\n\n - A cliff is a mass of rock that rises very high and is almost vertical, like a wall\n([source](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/cliff/))  \n - Cliffs have been around for hundreds of millions of years, and show no signs of going anywhere anytime soon. Fossils dating back 313 million years have been found inside of cliffs. ([source](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/grand-canyon-cliff-collapse-fossil-footprints-scn-trnd/index.html))  \n - Cliffs are known for forming major geographical features such as waterfalls. ([Source](http://justfunfacts.com/interesting-facts-about-cliffs/))  \n - Cliffs are the sole required equipment for the popular sport of cliff jumping ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_jumping))  \n&nbsp;  \n\n#Indications of Substantial Short Interest\n\nNow unfortunately **the SEC does not regulate municipalities or geological features** thus hedgefunds **are not required to report their short positions in these areas**. That said there are certainly some major indicators that these funds likely have **significant short positions** in both Cleveland and cliffs.  \n&nbsp;  \n**Cliffs:**  \n\n - The sport of \"Freestyle Cliff Jumping\" emerged in the 21st century, and has exploded in popularity. So much so that Redbull even now hosts a global cliff diving world series. ([source](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/event-series/redbull-cliffdiving)). Despite this clear rise in popularity of cliff related sporting, we have not seen a correlated expansion in the number of cliffs in the world. This is clearly a sign that the growth rate of cliffs is being heavily suppressed by short sellers.   \n - Cliffs are eroding at increasing rates. As of 2016 it was found that **England's famous white cliffs have been eroding at 10 times their previous rate** over the past 150 years ([source](https://phys.org/news/2016-11-england-white-cliffs-dover-eroding.html)). 150 years before 2016 was 1866. What could have happened in England in 1866 to kick off this increased erosion of cliffs? In 1866 the bank Overend, Gurney and Company took on substantial investments in long-term investments rather than holding short-term cash reserves as was necessary and found itself in a liquidity crisis that bankrupted the company leading to a financial collapse known the \"Panic of 1866\" in England ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overend,_Gurney_and_Company)). That begs the question, what were these investments that caused them such trouble? Could it be that they were illegally naked shorting the white cliffs? The timeline makes too much sense to ignore. The continued increased deterioration rates of these cliffs indicate that its likely still going on. Overend, Gurney and Compnay may have failed but certainly someone further up the chain took over their positions (Think of what we saw recently with Melvin Capital and Citadel)\n\n&nbsp;  \n**Cleveland:**  \n\n - Despite Cleveland's solid fundamentals, year to year growth of more than $1.5b and growth of $13b since 2009, Clevelands overall **economic growth ranks 2nd to last** among the 66 largest cities in the United States. ([source](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/wallethub-cleveland-slow-growing-city-survey/95-c99dafef-9398-4606-bea1-e1d1ce2da0c8)) **clearly short sellers are hammering this great city into the ground**.  \n - The 2011 hit movie \"[Kill The Irishman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Irishman)\"? Filmed in and based on events in the city of Cleveland. Who's the head of notorious short selling hedgefund **Citadel**? None other than **Ken Griffin**. Where's the surname Griffin popular? Griffin is a surname of **Irish**, English and Welsh origin ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_\\(surname\\))). Now we don't want to go full blown conspiracy nut here, but this looks like a pretty clear signal from the city of Cleveland that they want some serious revenge on our boy Ken Griffin. They must know that we own the entire float and there is illegal naked short selling going on.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n#\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 To The Moon?  \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00dc\n\nEven if we completely ignore the obvious short interest in both Cleveland and cliffs, if we look closely, they're both clearly trying to speak to us about an upcoming moonshot. At the end of the day it's really just like Ryan Cohen and DFVs incredibly obvious hints in their tweets.  \n&nbsp;  \n**Cliffs:**  \n\n - Trivia time. Where is the largest cliff in the solar system? Yup. Already waiting for us on the god damn moon \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00dc. Uranus' moon Miranda to be specific. The Verona Rupes cliff is estimated to be a whopping 12 miles high. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_Rupes)) nothing says \"\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 cliffs to the \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00dc\" like a giant cliff on an actual moon. We're not even talking just earth's moon, we're talking a moon over 1.6 billion miles away.  \n&nbsp;  \n\n**Cleveland:**  \n\n - Cleveland, Ohio is designated as a **GAMMA+** city by the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute ([source](https://www.spottedbylocals.com/blog/alpha-beta-and-gamma-cities/)).    \n - NASA's \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 Glenn Research Center is based in Cleveland.

That's right. **ROCKET \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 MORTGAGE FIELDHOUSE**.

It could be anything but here are some potential catalysts I've found in my research.   \n&nbsp;  \n**Cliffs:**  \n\n - Global Warming. Melting glacial ice and rising sea levels may unintuitively actually benefit cliffs. Sure, existing cliffs may face increased rates of erosion but said erosion also has the potential to create new cliffs as well. Everyone knows that hip new cliff is way cooler than a boring hundred million year old cliff. Now new cliffs being created by erosion from rising sea levels will likely take thousands of years, but melting glacial ice could also provide a shorter term catalyst. **For all we know there may be some fantastic cliffs hidden under all of that ice.** Ice melting away to reveal previously unknown cliffs could be a massive catalyst.  \n&nbsp;  \n\n**Cleveland:**  \n\n - Return of the King \u00ad\u0192\u00e6\u00e6? LeBron James has 2 years left on his contract with the Lakers. When it ends he will be 38 years old and likely at or nearing retirement. It would only be fitting for him to come back to Cleveland where it all started to finish up his career. **The return of LeBron would be a massive financial boon for the city of Cleveland**, likely blowing short sellers out of the water and inducing game ending **margin calls \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7**.  \n\n - The Hyperloop Project. There are plans in place for a hyperloop train between Cleveland and Chicago that could cover the 300+ miles in only 28 minutes. Recently plans were announced to expand this project to connected Cleveland and New York as well. ([source](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-hyperloop-project-eyes-expanding-route-to-include-new-york-city-in-early-phase)). **Having such quick/easy access to two of countries largest cities could be a huge draw to living in the city of Cleveland.**  \n&nbsp;  \n\n**$CLF:**  \n\n - WSB apes taking an obvious shitpost too seriously and actually buying a stock because of it.

Wish currently has a cash balance of $1.62 billion. This is very bullish because it means that Wish will be around at least for another 4.69 quarters (let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s say until June 2022).

We only need to buy and hold for nearly a week for this to happen. Look up any previous DD post on CLNE where they explain the reason it is being shorted (revenue growth is expected in the medium to long term so it looks like easy money for hedge funds). [Here is a link with short interest over the past year for anyone lazy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clne/short-interest).\n\nCLNE also has several partnerships in the works including a large deal to provide RNG (carbon renewable natural gas) to Amazon for their delivery trucks, and in general green energy is growing priority for the USA and the world in general. As someone who is probably most risk averse than most people here, this makes me feel better as I can always hold in case of a sudden dip for longer term gains.\n\nI also did some more research after reading some of the more surface level posts on CLNE and found that they built their stations near existing Amazon warehouses, which gives them an advantage when negotiating future deals as transportation of materials is factored into negotiations (from what I know, I work as a software engineer for a steel manufacturing business).\n\nCLNE has also not even reached it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s all time high of $16 yet (even with a 8.5% after hours gain), whereas most of the other meme'd stocks have well surpassed their's and are in the pump-and-dump territory that leads to a lot of paper handing.

Wish local allows brick and mortar retail shops to store wish inventory for very low cost, unlike expensive Amazon fulfillment center real estate. The retail store gets the benefit of potential new customers walking in their door to pick up wish packages, they have the option to deliver the package for wish (for compensation), and they get to upload their own inventory to wish\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s platform to reach a global customer base. This also helps wish reduce shipping times. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a win win. There were over 55,000 wish local partners as of Q1. \n\nWish is focusing on getting more expensive (branded) products on the platform because they note it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s more profitable to sell higher priced goods, or at least multiple cheap goods in one delivery. They\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re focusing marketing strategy on retaining high Life Time Value customers, as opposed to people that buy once and never return. \n\nTheir logistics revenue grew 300% in 2020 to over $500 million.

That's still a sweet opportunity.", "self_text": "Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.\n\nLong before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that's where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle \"the Enterprise of Things.\" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom!\n\nIt's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. \n\nStill Green!\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line!\n\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past.

I mean, how the fuck does [my one DD on WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) cause a $4.4b stock to move up 11% (~$450m in market cap)? Clearly something must be wrong with the market, right?!\n\nHere's some fun [math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msDuNZyYAIQ#t=41) for you: WWE's IV was 35%. The standard deviation for a daily move (using the rule of 16) is 35/16 = 2.1875%. It moved 11%/2.1875% -- about *five* standard deviations. The odds of that? Roughly 1 in 1.74 million. (Let me know if this is miscalculated).\n\nSo how does a 1 in 1.74 million event occur? And, more practically: Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?\n\n# The SMELL - high bang for the buck\n\nIf you remember my [first post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/), I chose this ticker due to it passing the SMELL test:\n\n* **S**hort Interest is high\n* **M**arket cap is high\n* **E**xtremely Memeable\n* **L**ow IV  <-- (implies low volume, as well)\n* **L**ow Float\n\nWhat differentiates WWE from other new meme stocks (CLOV, CLNE, etc) are the Low IV and Low Volume. I'll touch on that in a sec.\n\nFirst, let's get one thing straight. The bump from yesterday was **definitely** from my original post. To me that's incredible... because I don't even consider that post a wild success:\n\n* It didn't hit the frontpage.\n* It was buried a few pages deep for awhile (it got a late start).\n* In the end, it garnered 1k upvotes and 230 comments.\n* WWE reached something like #25 in mentions on WSB. Meh.\n* **Yet, still, caused a *five sigma* move in the stock.** That's pretty good leverage.\n\nI think that's the SMELL at work -- particularly the low IV and low volume. There's just not much liquidity in this stock. Not much of the market cares about it. If they did, then after settling down at $65.00, with volume tapering off.. where were the profit takers? Where were the shorts? **A 10% day with *zero* news, and momentum seemingly fading... and it stays at +10% five sigma levels?**  With a single 1k upvote WSB post?\n\nI'm bullish.\n\n# Show me the memes\n\nNow do me a favor and find some second-generation meme stocks with DD-post numbers that low that have done *anything*. Seriously, I'd be grateful if you find one. I don't think any stock has moved 11%, much less five sigma of its IV, from a single DD before. (Well, maybe CLNE. But it wasn't five sigma, and it was already widely discussed recently before the run-up. I could be wrong here.)\n\nA more typical example: CLF, a new star, a had *several* DD posts yesterday, all raking in *multiple times* the amount of upvotes and comments. And what did CLF do yesterday? Up 14%. With an IV of 60%, a 14% move is 3.2 standard deviations away, or 1 in 1000 odds. All of that attention and it breaks out by an amount 1000x more likely than what happened to WWE.\n\n**WWE got far less attention, but moved a much more significant amount.** See what I'm saying?\n\nAlso yesterday, the other second-generation meme tickers were fetching in tens of thousands of upvotes across several posts. They seemed to just hang out. Some dumped. Meanwhile, WWE just hangs out even while the WSB \"trend\" ranking is like [#26](https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/) on the rankings. (Scroll down to \"Trend Map\" or Ctrl+F for WWE).  It's mentions count is *way down there* .. below CRSR, BARK, SI, SDC, TWNK, and a bunch of other shit I had no idea anybody still cared about or just started fawning over.\n\n**And, yet, WWE pumped and did not dump.**\n\n> Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?\n\nI believe there is simply not much real inflows or outflows in WWE.\n\nRemember, the daily volume on this was generally very low, the IV was very low, and it's 120% insitutionally owned. Nobody trades this, it's not expected to move much, and the shareholders are boomer funds. How many of those institutional owners actually reposition their holdings regularly? I don't think many. At least, not many did yesterday.\n\nThe WSB post started reaching obscurity, but WWE held steady at 11% gains -- with literally *no fundamentals* changing from day before. The shorts are being cautious, and the longs are just chilling.\n\n**If you believe that my one shitty little post was enough for what happened yesterday, then you should see that it doesn't take much to move this stock.** With WWEs meme potential, and it being short squeeze season, there's a lot of upside, and not a whole lot of downside (maybe -11%, back down to where it was).\n\n# News Porn\n\nThis type of coverage can't hurt:\n\n- Bloomberg: [Newest Meme Stocks Extend Gains With No Sign of Craze Fading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-09/newest-meme-stocks-extend-gains-as-craze-shows-no-sign-of-fading)\n- Motley Fool: [Why WWE Sotck Jumped 21.5% today](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/09/why-wwe-stock-jumped-215-today/)\n- SBNation: [WWE stock could be getting the Gamestop treatment](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2021/6/9/22526765/wwe-memestock-reddit-share-prices-surge) - I got mentioned by name lol\n- Investor's Business Daily: [Meme-mania Sends WWE Stock Flying As AMC Is Slammed](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-slips-meme-mania-sends-wwe-stock-flying-amc-stock-slammed-microsoft-gains/)\n\nAdmittedly surreal to see these.\n\n# tHe sQuEeZE iS nOt sQuOZe\n\nIn case any of you are into this for the squeeze potential - 22% of available float - let's discuss. If you don't care about sqeeziness, great, you can skip this.\n\nI don't believe we saw any squeeze yesterday:\n\n* Post market and pre market shows extremely bullish activity.\n* MMs and quant algos see an uptick in WWE mentions on \"the bane of our existance\"\n* Asks for options go up defensively\n* Market opens, and plethora of options orders come in. (Not a crazy amount, just 1k upvotes worth). They continually hit the ask and ramp up the volatility.\n* MMs are forced to gobble up shares to deltahedge from both the new options, and also the *huge* gap at open, and also the *huge* increase in IV. Remember, based on the prices they've sold the existing OI, this is a *five sigma* event.\n* On a stock with hardly any volume to support that.\n* Stock wobbles around as the feeding frenzy ensues\n* Volumes tapers down, stock holds at +10%\n\nNo hockey stick squeeze. No high volume spikes mid day. Thus, I think no margin calls and no covering.\n\n**Furthermore, I'm told Ortex did not show a decrease in shares on loan.** I'll update this tomorrow when that data becomes available.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt is my opinion that non-retail longs and shorts are just sitting on the sidelines. Not much profit taking, not much shorting, and not much covering. They're all being cautious. Look at institutional ownership of this thing. **120%.** How many of these fund managers are going to reposition their WWE holdings mid-day? Probably not many.\n\nI feel like yesterday's movement was all us, MMs, and HFTs shuffling. Just from one itty bitty 1k upvote post. That's a lot of leverage. The SMELL in real. What happens if this post hits 2k? Or this thing gets memed by others? What happens if shorts actually start to cover? What happens if there's an acquisition?\n\n*But don't kid yourself... this is still speculative.*\n\nI'm now *less* bullish, but not bearish, about:\n\n* A fundamentals based justification of current share price.\n\nI'm now *more* bullish about:\n\n* The impact that visibility here could have on the share price.\n* The probability of shorts covering, probably slowly for now, but possibly biting the bullet if we get into the $70s.\n* The IV getting more jacked (90% IV is high for this ticker, but low for a meme-stock)\n\nAnd, lastly, when this thing peaked just after open and you all complained about not getting in: Well, [I felt ugly. I felt stupid. I felt gay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_do8VgY4bqI&t=50s) Sorry about that. My next DD, if I find another SMELLy stock, will be during market hours.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* I'm bullish that a single 1k-upvoted DD on WSB, reaching only #25 most mentioned, was able to move this stock 11% up (+$440m to market cap)... which @ 35% IV is a five sigma event. About 1 in 1.7 million.\n* By comparison, CLF had several posts each with ~3k upvotes, 3x the comments, etc, and it saw a 14% move. That's 3.2 sigma move, about 1 in 1000.\n* To me that indicates there is not much liquidity in WWE, and the volume yesterday was MMs, HFTs, quant funds, and retail buying options and shares.\n* 120% institutional ownership must have a lot of float locked up as well, and they're not in the business of repositioning randomly on a bump with no news.\n* Price **held** at +11% -- five sigma above what the market thought this was valued at a day ago, despite no news. Why no sell-off?\n* Again -- all this from a single *moderately successful* post.\n* To me this reads as bullish: the small visibility on WSBs has a massive impact on the share price. More massive than any other tickers I've seen catch on here lately.\n* I saw no signs of covering or margin calls. Neither did Ortex.

Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai commodity exchanges all seeing highs. Chinese steel production peaked twice this year, in April and March.\n\n\\- A little more than a month ago, Chinese officials **recalled their 13% VAT Rebate on steel exports,** without providing exporters or foreign buyers with a transitionary period. The world's biggest steelmaker just said **fuck you, we're keeping our steel.**\n\n\\- From China's POV, it's a smart move. They stabilize domestic markets while decreasing their (worrisome) trade surplus, and an excess of domestic supply could fuel future infrastructure projects.... blah blah blah I know you apes aren't here for this boomer macro shit. Moral of this paragraph is, China probably won't reinstate that VAT rebate any time soon.\n\n**So What?**\n\nyou would think the rest of the world could just tell China to fuck off and make their own steel, but *Chinese steel still trades at a significant discount to the rest of the global commodities market.* Long story short, Chinese labor is cheap, the country's inspection agencies and most of its producers are state-run, so no one inspects anything or gives a fuck. And right now, everyone just wants to fucking buy steel.\n\n**IN APE LANGUAGE/ TLDR:**\n\n*Imagine you're thrown on Ape Island for 7-9 quarters with 500 dudes, 5000 apes, and 50 hookers. Naturally, you and the other dudes/apes get a lil urge. High demand = the hookers get a lot of work. They gradually increase their prices (because, for the lack of a better analogy, the supply of fiat currency has vastly outpaced the production of commodities).  There's this one group of hookers who sleeps with everyone for the cheapest.

My July calls are up 125%! Let's keep it up!\n\nThe next opportunity, albeit not your typical short squeeze, gamma squeeze, or any other squeeze of the sort. It is actually a pretty straightforward bet.\n\nAllow me to Introduce **Uranium..**   \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5  \u00d4\u00ff\u00f3\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\n\nAh, sure, you guys can probably dismiss it but here me out. There are 3 big ETFs in the sector. URA, HURA, and URNM. URNM has been outperforming its rival by adding smaller and more speculative names. On stocks that get added to the index, we usually talk about small float and market caps that are sub 100m when added. There is an indiscriminate buy of the underlying equity for the next 3 weeks after the index rebalancing.\n\nIn March, I had done that research and got lucky on a couple of names added to the index. I circled in Red the period at which the index bough, and you can see the surge in volume. The great thing is that this ETF keeps growing in size because of the renewed interest in Uranium. That means that they need to keep buying shares at whatever price the asking price is every month to keep the relative position in % in the ETF. The below stock is Western Uranium and Vanadium. They also have strong fundamentals and are a perfect M&A target for their next-door neighbor Energy Fuels. The current Ceo of Western owns 15% of the shares, and the share structure is super tight. They are currently only in the URNM ETF, and I think they have a good chance at getting into URA, the biggest ETF in the uranium sector. I obviously own a lot of shares, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\n[Western Uranium & Vanadium](https://preview.redd.it/owr8e1nfqa471.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=13053cecc2e1c29fecb86022fe4b4db31a56a285)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should ask yourself which other stock could be picked up by URA in the July rebalancing. That, in my opinion, is simple. You can check which stocks are owned by their rival URNM and HURA. There is only a handful of names that are not in the URA ETF. These names are:\n\nLaramide resources\n\nAzzarga Uranium\n\nMega Uranium\n\nVimy resources\n\nToro Energy\n\nForsys metals\n\nIf you are willing to wait a bit more, the URNM rebalancing happens in September. Currently, the best 2 performing stocks in Uranium this year are **Alligator Energy and Elevate Uranium**. They will most probably get included in the ETF as well. They could also make it in the URA rebalancing in July, but I see this as less likely. Another name that is on the cusp and could well make it into the ETF is Anfield Energy.\n\nAnother short-term catalyst is the transaction of Sprott acquiring the Uranium participation corp. For those of you who have been sleeping under a rock, Sprott has been able to grow its Gold and Silver ETF assets under management significantly. They intend to do the same with the Uranium participation corp, which buys and holds physical uranium. It used to be that when the fund's net asset value was +20%, they would issue more shares and buy more uranium. Sprott, however, will have an NYSE listing instead of a Canadian listing and will be an active buyer every month on the Spot market. The current spot for Uranium is at 32$, and we will need to seed 40$ to 45$ to see the party begin. Many in the space believe this will happen due to this move from Sprott on top of the foreseen shortage from all the supply destruction since Fukushima.\n\nAt this point, you should already have understood that you can front run institution and that this in itself is a great arbitrage-like situation. See the rise in URNM ETF. Quite interesting for a boring bet based on supply and demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[URNM ETF](https://preview.redd.it/gut63asnqa471.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=407bc70ae5d28c4d09b485f8a94ce7e979bcd2c8)\n\nThe current Market Cap of the total Uranium space is roughly 30billion in Market Cap. During the 2004-2009 bull market, the total market cap achieved for the total Uranium was 150 billion meaning an easy 5x from here in total. The granddaddy of performance was Paladin back then which started as a junior and became a big producer. The stock went from 0.03$ to 9.53$ in 4 years. Paladin is still a solid pick as they will be one of the first producers. Still, if you are looking at a story like Paladin today, I think a couple of names have the management and experience to bring an explorer to a producer within the next 4 to 5 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Paladin from 2004-2007](https://preview.redd.it/kms8r9arqa471.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c110601cef38b87e1b2d6791b11218afcc0575)\n\nTo reproduce this, you need to be in a jurisdiction that permits fast, or you have to have all the permits already. You need great management. You need a deposit. It helps if you also have short-term catalysts such as the ETFs or the potential to acquire a bigger player. Based on this, I think only a couple of names can be considered.\n\n**Alligator energy**: In South Australia, strong management created billions in shareholder value in the last bull market. Deposit and strong jurisdiction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lt2kbznvqa471.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=908c04ad62d33c7a225cbfdb9284cca1171eb41c\n\n**Elevate uranium** located in Namibia. Far from a producer, they have great resources; they are next to mills, which means they would not need to build one; they are in the best jurisdiction in the world. Management is not as strong as Alligator but higher share structure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4q6gj38yqa471.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd46de10341237dcdaf5687f4f9ce31e6c48187\n\n**Western uranium** can come into production quite fast but need to strike a deal to mill the ore with Energy fuels. The shares outstanding are so small, making it susceptible to massive moves every time there is a buyer in the market with decent volume.\n\n**Azzaraga** has a great deposit, can start production fast, and needs low CAPEX to get there. They have a good management team. Either Encore Energy or Ur-Energy can easily buy them.\n\n**Laramide resource**: Management is top-notch. Great diversified assets. They can come into production or be sold. The CEO has been with the company forever and holds 10% of the shares.\n\nIf you need more resources to double down on, I suggest John Quakes on Twitter, Uranium insider is also another great name to follow.\n\nI also suggest this great podcast discussion if you want to get up to speed as to why the uranium sector will more than 5x in the next 2-3 years.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9tDyYKUhuw&t=6337s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9tDyYKUhuw&t=6337s)\n\nCheers,\n\nMax", "votes": 145, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9996, "date_posted": "2021-06-09 20:07:36", "date_pulled": "2021-06-10 12:07:44", "reddit_post_id": "nw51ax"}, "795": {"post_id": 15089, "author_id": 554536, "post_title": "Memetacular TA DD -

For those of you who don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know and are literally trading stocks without paying attention to anything going on in the economy, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) number is the main gauge of inflation.\n\n**How big?**\n\n10% or more, depending on the magnitude of the CPI beat.\n\n**Why?**\n\nA feedback loop driven by algorithms that trade based on bond market data.\n\n**Why should I give a shit about the bond market?**\n\nI don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t trade bonds, and think bonds are for fucking nerds and boomers, but if you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been in the market since the beginning of the year you know that the bonds, specifically 10 year treasuries, are arguably the most important market drivers in the world. The bond market is about twice as big as the stock market and the price action of bonds dictates the movement of the stock market to a large degree. A big swing in the bond market has the potential to completely fuck the dynamics of the stock market and the CPI. When bonds get bought, the 10 year yield goes down and when they get sold, the yield goes up. The 10 year yield also goes up in response to inflation and dictates the mortgage rate one can get at a given time, the interest rate at which businesses can borrow money, etc. It is therefore a very important indicator for earnings predictions and general economics. Algorithms (which account for about 80% of stock market volume( either directly look at the 10 year yield to make trades or derive earnings estimates and other money flow from the 10 year yield.\n\n**What have 10 year treasuries been doing lately?**\n\nAt the beginning of the year there was a correction based on a rising 10 year yield that was particularly bad for growth and tech stocks that do well in a low interest rate environment. The 10 year yield has been very low over the past year because when the market crashed, the fed enacted historically dovish monetary policy to bolster stocks and the overall economy. One of the policies the fed enacted was purchasing of bonds by the US treasury in order to keep the 10 year yield stable.  In recent months there has been talk of a \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3taper tantrum\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8  wherein the fed begins to phase out those stabilizing purchases as the economy recovers. Powell has been adamant that he will keep treasury purchase in place for the time being and that he will give us plenty of warning before he begins to taper bond purchases.\n\nLast week, the fed announced that it was going to stop buying corporate bonds and ETFs, which was another dovish policy similar to treasury purchases that they were doing in the corporate bond market. The fed wasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t doing a huge amount of corporate bond buying so that wasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t a huge deal for the economy or market, but caused some to get nervous that the fed may be getting ready to ease 10 year note purchases in the months ahead. However, this fear was short-lived because last week, employment data came in that showed lower-than-expected job growth.\n\nGenerally, job growth is a very important inflation indicator. So important that until a few months ago when the fed changed its mandate, it was the main factor determining whether the fed would raise or lower interest rates. A cool employment number caused the bond market (also largely algorithm-driven) to buy a lot of 10 year bonds because weaker job growth is supposed to mean weaker-than-expected inflation. Therefore, over the past week, the 10 year yield has made a big move (about 8%) down and caused the broader indexes to rally. The S&P, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq are all at or near record highs based largely on the fact that bond yields have been going down and algorithms have been triggered to buy. Right now the 10 year is hovering around 1.5%, which is the lowest rate it has been since March. Since the initial rise at the beginning of the year, the 10 year has typically bounced off of the 1.5% level and has gotten as high as 1.77%. Despite the rise of the 10 year, it is still well below its pre-crash levels of 2% or more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2 year chart of the 10 year yield](https://preview.redd.it/npzrc0s5x9471.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f677385d1bbe1818de4612b4a742b134f2d48f5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 year chart of the 10 year yield](https://preview.redd.it/86w5vq76x9471.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=b781261e8851b982fdfd6d66c20afb9ca59c83b4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is going to happen to the 10 year yield going forward and how is that going to trigger an algorithm-fueled, gay bear feedback loop?**\n\nAbove I talked about how the 10 year yield fell on the cool jobs number. The glitch in the market matrix started last week when the ADP private payroll number came out. The report said 978,000 new jobs were created in May, a high number that was relatively in-line with most estimates. However, the ADP report has, for some reason, not been accurate over the past year or so. When the real employment number published by the government came out the following day, showing a mere 559,000 jobs being created, a corrective rally in 10 year treasury notes started and has persisted into today, driving the 10 year yield to multi-month lows.\n\n*To summarize what has happened so far: ADP gave an employment number that diverged from the government employment number, the government employment number missed estimates, bond traders and algorithms derived a low inflation number from those low employment numbers and overcompensated bond purchases, bond yield went down, stonks went up.*\n\nThis overcompensation could affect the bond and stock market tomorrow and in the weeks ahead. There are a few potential catalysts that could drive a big move in the 10 year and the downstream stock market over the next week. The first one is a 10 year note auction today at 1 pm. While I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t expect the auction to cause a major change in treasuries, there is a possibility that some selling could occur this afternoon to cause fluctuation in the 10 year since the price is at a multi-month high. Tomorrow and next week are huge catalysts though, because the CPI number is being released. While bond traders and algorithms attempt to derive a rough inflation number from employment data, the CPI number is the \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3real number\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 that indicates the level of inflation the economy is experiencing and what price people are paying in the typical transaction. On Wednesday next week, the Fed meeting and Powell\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s subsequent comments will dictate how the Fed will respond to the inflation number and whether it will raise interest rates (it won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t) or begin tapering bond purchases (it might).\n\n*The bear thesis is contingent on tomorrow\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s CPI number being a huge beat.* That was the case last month and a big reason for the May selloff. While the expected number was 0.4% MoM, the actual number was double that (0.9%). Given that 10 year bonds are very overbought with an 8% rally this week, a hot CPI number like the one we saw in May could raise the 10 year yield as much as 10 basis points. If it goes up 5 or more basis points, a correction is highly likely and will have a magnitude proportional to the strength of the 10 year yield move. This is not guaranteed. This month\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s CPI number is projected to be 0.3%, but based on various factors like continued housing market strength, increased oil prices (especially over the past month and with a big miss on crude inventories data this morning), and general price increases (see Chipotle news), I tend to think 0.3% is a very low estimate. Moreover, employment data may have been a red herring for bond traders and algos because of the continued unemployment assistance being given by the government. While a weak jobs number would normally produce a similarly weak CPI number, unemployment assistance has the ability to elevate prices without job growth. That is the main issue with the data being used by algos right now. While the bond market won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t necessarily react violently to a hot CPI number, the recent rally has it primed for a selloff and resultant spike in yields.\n\n**Other Red Flags**\n\nA few other things happening in the global economy and in volatility are making me nervous.\n\n*A big one is China.* Yesterday, China released its own CPI along with its PPI (producer price index, or cost to manufacture goods). The Chinese economy showed a divergence between CPI and PPI, which is irregular. While Chinese producers showed the biggest overhead cost increase in decades, they seem to have decided to eat the cost and elected not to pass the price increase on to consumers. This makes sense if you agree with Powell\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s standpoint on inflation being \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3transitory\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 (temporary). Eating production cost increases isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t a big deal if it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s only for a few months and while it might cause company profits to dip, it won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have a far-reaching economic impact unless it is sustained and producers are forced to pass the price increase to consumers. While I agree that huge inflation reads like I expect tomorrow are transitory, I still think overall inflation has picked up in a relatively permanent way. The current labor shortage along with job creation via stimulus and potential infrastructure spending will force companies to offer new employees higher salaries and increase salaries permanently across the board.  Also, something tells me US companies are less likely to eat increased production costs than Chinese companies which rely on low costs to gain an advantage over foreign rivals. There is also the possibility of the government instructing its companies to hold off on price increases while the recovery is taking place.\n\n*Also, volatility is at an inflection point*. I follow volatility pretty closely, understand it, and have [written about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmt5s0/fyi_for_people_new_to_the_vix_and_vix_etfs_before/) in the past if you want to understand it better.  Currently, the VIX (which measures options premiums of S&P 500 stocks) is near post-crash lows. It got as low as 16.57 yesterday, which is about 7% off the low (not a lot for the VIX), and has generally bounced off of that range during swings over the past year. Today it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s up to 17.21. For comparison, it got up to near 22.00 during the May correction and was in the high 30s during January when meme\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s almost destroyed the stock market. While a VIX rally doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t necessarily mean there will be a correction, high option premiums imply that institutions are hedging big swings. VVIX, the derivative of the VIX which measures the rate at which options premiums are changing and generally goes up prior to big moves, is way up today (9%). VXN, the new volatility measurement of the Nasdaq, is also near post-crash lows. While volatility is still elevated compared to 2019, the next couple of weeks will determine whether volatility decreases to pre-crash levels (10.00-20.00) or continues to stay in the range it has been in (20.00 to 40.00). Continued volatility decrease would be a good sign for the market, but I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m not sure we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re ready yet given the uncertainty of the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX 5-year](https://preview.redd.it/ia5px807x9471.png?width=306&format=png&auto=webp&s=198a46dabc5be7208f5b5a5f05332b70a562b141)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VXN 1-year](https://preview.redd.it/ug7tanllx9471.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=c40b2b31cbb1b4a8bdcd17bc14c37a23af3de7d0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VVIX 5-year](https://preview.redd.it/0f1umd0mx9471.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=223bb17deeb58e7517ed49d15399e733ade51d14)\n\n**Powell**\n\nIf there is a correction, the length of time it will last is based largely on the Powell testimony. A hot CPI number might cause bond markets to freak out, but the fed\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s stance will largely dictate whether a spike in the 10 year is confirmed and continues into the 2% range or if it stays steady. The CPI number will play a little bit into the speed at which the fed tapers asset purchases but they already know what they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re going to say next week for the most part. Another part of my bearishness has to do with my opinion that Powell will announce tapering between now and the end of the year next week, which could cause a correction regardless of tomorrow\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s inflation data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oh yeah, RSI**\n\nEdit: I forgot to add in the part about the indexes being overbought. They aren't horribly overbought like at levels we saw in September, but they're at levels they've bounced off of a few times in the past. This means there is plenty to sell if there is a bearish catalyst. In recent months, SPY has been able to do okay maintaining rallies in overbought conditions, while QQQ has performed pretty poorly when RSI gets above 70. RSI spikes (in either direction) on the yearly chart have been decent forward indicators of corrections since 2020.\n\n[SPY 1 year chart + RSI \\(14 periods\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ls1lnf550a471.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=94eb971ff4bf2cd871d072857db4b61a95b19dd9)\n\n[QQQ 1 year chart + RSI \\(14 periods\\)](https://preview.redd.it/a56een550a471.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a7e055a99428a020994dc01fc413ac277504f4b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to play**\n\nDon\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t buy VXX, UVXY, or any other leveraged index fund or volatility tracker. Those suck, have low upside, and don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t necessarily go up and down the market (see link above for explanation of VIX futures funds). Just play puts in the indexes (or calls if you disagree with me). I tend to think that monthly QQQ and IWM options are good targets because they have more beta than SPY. But the Nasdaq has already had a big correction while SPY has been largely unaffected and is closer to (may close today at) record highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Bond market could shit its pants and cause a correction if the market underestimated the inflation data coming out tomorrow. Happy Pride Month.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the pee martini, kind stranger!\n\nEdit (6/10): CPI was higher than expected but not as bad as I thought it would be. Market correction may be delayed until Powell testimony but could still start today or tomorrow. If futures go down >1% that's a bad sign for indexes. Look for a 7+ basis point daily gain on the 10 year yield. Look for a fast dip in RSI. All of these are indicators that it's imminent. \n\nPowell will likely have to announce the taper next week and it will likely be gradually until the end of the year. Markets will probably bounce next month when the CPI report reveals that inflation is normalizing. However, oil prices have been spiking in June so if they continue to rise then CPI might not give a normalish print until August. If indexes see a >10% correction, give up YTD gains, and panic ensues, it will be the best buying opportunity of the year.

I want to put my apes in the game, so I'm going to explain how valuation on this one is a bit different. There was a lot of bad info being passed off here yesterday that needs to be cleared up.", "self_text": "First, I posted here regularly under another username, but am attempting to not doxx myself as there's been a lot more traffic here the past few months.\n\nNow, the main point: CLF's business is based on a *cyclical* commodity, in this case, steel. Cyclicals experience cycles (duh) in demand and pricing, which can drastically impact the earnings of companies that depend on them. Things like steel, rail, real-estate, airlines, etc. are all cyclical, with demand drastically ebbing and flowing over time. While share prices of the companies also can swing, those runs and dips are less drastic. **Here is the key point:** When the commodity prices/demand for whatever that cyclical company offers are dropping, **earnings multiples rise**. This is because the share price may have dipped *some* (or remained steady) but the earnings actually dropped. When the commodity prices/demand that a cyclical company depends on are rising, **earnings multiples compress**. This is because share price may have run *some* (or remained steady) but earnings have skyrocketed. If you work in the industry you'll typically figure out what mid-cycle earnings look like and apply a mid-cycle multiple to it if you're valuing it.\n\nI saw a couple posts here yesterday that completely fucked this up. They were applying sky-high multiples (from when steel & CLF earnings were shitting the bed) to *current* projected earnings for the steel company, and using that to put out some smooth-brain-tier estimates as to what this *should* be valued at. So looking at forward multiples, for 2022, *currently* CLF is valued at a P/E of \\~11.9x. Here is a screen-shot of some stats over the past 10 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t6st8aq3g471.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4b5ad97c97a5c09d91d39c99954136f4cf24f54\n\nThe *median* is 8.62x (also note the average, which reflects ridiculous pops in ratio when steel, and thus CLF earnings, shit the bed). In other words, steel would have to increase even further from these ridiculous levels and projected 2022 earnings would have to increase by 40% to justify current valuations...oooooor the share price could retract. That doesn't sound too hot, right?\n\nWell don't despair, because the data is muddy: For 2021 forward earnings (which incorporates the current run), we're at a 5.6x P/E right now, with a 10 year median of 7.1x. In other words, about a 20% increase in price based on these earnings would bring us in line, or steel prices would need to drop by quite a bit to get us closer to median P/E for the current year.\n\n**Conclusion:** In other words, this isn't as clear-cut as some of those posts yesterday make it seem. If you *believe* that steel prices are going to remain near historical highs, then CLF is under-valued, by about 20% based on the past decade. But long-term support past this second half of this year is going to require another leg up *past* where steel prices are right now.

The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.\nI am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.\n- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021\n- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting\n- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.\nShares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192\n- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:\nInstitutional Stock Ownership 12.6%\nInstitutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%\nMutual Fund Ownership 3.2%\nInsider Ownership 6.5%\nOther 67.4%\n\nTotal of institution ownership:\n12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%\nTotal of the rest excluding individual retail investors:\n26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%\nEquivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:\n32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares\nShares needed to cover the records:\n-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M\n- Synthetic shares:\ntotal number of synthetic shares: Z\nnaked shorts: X\nnaked call contracts: Y\nother naked shares: W\nZ = X + Y + W\nShort interest:\nAssuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares\nMinimum number of synthetic shares from public records:\n100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)\nHidden number of synthetic shares:\nU: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.\nMinimum number of synthetic shares\n37M + U\n- Bottom line:\n37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.\n\nHope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought.

Unless it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a hard-to-get item, then I got to E-Bay maybe Etsy or purchase directly from the vendor\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s site. If I need volume, I will use Alibaba (but it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a f#$%ing hassle to deal with import tax and delivery on heavy items). I have yet to try Ali Express. \n\nBecause I have never heard of Wish until now, I immediately installed the app and by the end of the night sent an invite code to 3 people and purchased roughly $184 of stuff I wanted to get. \n\nThe app has a nice flow and it upsells using promo codes and add-hoc discounts. Very addictive experience, perfect for a retarded consumer such as myself. That night I ended up with: \n\n* Green Point Laser that could start a fire $12.00 ship cost $4\n* 100 pc drill bit set $8.64 ship cost $11.50\n* 3 pc ex drill set $5.26 ship cost $11.50 \n* 46 pc repair tools/socket wrench $18.23 ship cost $1.00\n* 50 pc titanium drill bit set $9.00 ship cost $3.00\n* Blue tooth mini ear buds $1.89 ship cost $1.00\n* 7 Inch Tablet with Quad core $0.50 (new) ship cost $3.65 (how the F#$%\\^ is that so low, must see it to believe it)\n* Car Cellphone Charger $18.21 ship cost $3.65\n* Tactical flash light $8.55 ship cost $11.50\n* 20x50 HiDef Wide Angle Binoculars $39.00 ship cost $11.50 ( $1400 MSRP  ... have to see it to believe it)\n* Automotive Error code reader $0.50 (ffs @ 0.50 cents I just bought it to see what its like) ship cost $0.75\n* Polarized sun glasses (gift at join) ship cost: $1.00\n\nSo now I wait for it all to arrive. Some of the things are shipped from USA and labeled as such and many other things will take more time as they come from Gina et all (similar to E-Bay and Alibaba) \n\nI was blown away at how cheap and easy it was to place the order. Shipping didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t make sense for some of the things, but the price offset that. \n\nThe feeling I had was similar to when I walked into a Walmart store for the first time. The only thing nagging me is that most of the things I bought from Walmart either broke or I threw away so I have a full expectation of the same for the above-mentioned products, but this is not the point and I digress.\n\n**If the above items arrive as described, Wish is my new go to online shopping.**  \n \n\n# Financial Consideration\n\nAmazon and Alibaba are obvious competitors. Because Wish is relatively new it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s not turning a profit. However, the steady Revenue and user base growth over-compensates this in my opinion.\n\nBased on [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/) I am expecting **2021 Revenue to be around $3.65B** based on historic values\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmmqaxh50h471.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a51d82a88df08e2c5df5209616e543f4a785ab\n\nWISH user base has a very solid growth \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uwnaip10h471.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a20cb2fd7ddc01223a9df0ce29d85a701fbd8cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Based on finance.yahoo.com stats as of 6/10/2021:\n\n* **AMAZON Profitability**\n   * Profit Margin 6.42% \n   * Price to Sales 4.01  \n* **BABA Profitability**\n   * Profit Margin 20.99% \n   * Price to Sales 5.24  \n* WISH **Profitability**\n   * **Profit Margin -28.09%**\n   * **Price to Sales 2.5** \n\nI personally value stock on how much Revenue it could generate.\n\nSo, given my estimated revenue for 2021 of $3.65B and WISH\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price of $10.79 as of 6/10/2021 it is roughly 2X-3X undervalued against the competitors.

So don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t fucking follow it, you fucking donkey! Rather, treat it as a technical hypothesis, or a fun TA brain candy - and tell me what you think, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6d like to gather some sweet retarded feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjo0vjdoah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c8a2e3bcc54035412afdb6ea5cba9d21f91e31c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ubr6zypah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38830e5af516fe0ab5d8c9f6824f91d6f0a6bd65\n\nWithout further ado, let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n\nAs you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. \n\nSo far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.\n\nAnother thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.\n\nAnd the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).\n\nOverall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?\n\nLove you and fuck you with all of my heart,\n\nRoman, aka TA degenerate.\n\nOh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:\n\n[AMC](https://preview.redd.it/3fgyr3zhah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4701c608c386223824d143c9e254d858894db33)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME](https://preview.redd.it/sxymaf3kah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f876de00fb46e79f783756ab5bd7b0fe6f41f0f3)", "votes": 327, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9917, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 18:10:41", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:05:48", "reddit_post_id": "nwub7d"}, "851": {"post_id": 15145, "author_id": 147433, "post_title": "Life savings all in on BB", "self_text": "So, I YOLO'ed my entire savings into Blackberry and here's some photos to show how screwed I probably am.\n\nBut its ok, I'm just gonna hold for a few years and see if I can get my money back.\n\nI held GME from $250 to $400 to $40 to $350 to $160'ish and finally selling at $260 so I can hold forever if need be.\n\nBought an initial 400 CAD shares in my TFSA account back in Jan/Feb., then bought 1500 U.S. shares recently, then another 1200 CAD shares yesterday.

With CLNE\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6S established brand and reputation in the renewable gas industry, I believe they are well-positioned to serve the growing demands for RNG. \n\nCompany Overview\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.\n\nRNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.\n\n2020 Financial Results\n\n**Revenue:** CLNE\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&M services. Despite 2020\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.\n\n**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll help with seeing shareholder returns.\n\n**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (\n\nRecent Developments\n\n**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.\n\n**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M. \u252c\u00e1This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.\n\n**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.\n\nInvestment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG\n\nThe demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:\n\n* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord\n* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years\n* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n\nRenewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWith CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport\n\nSources:\n\n1.

Warning extreme DD, requires wrinkled brain.", "self_text": "Senseonics Holdings, Inc., is a medical technology company, that develops and manufactures a unique implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.\n\nEversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.\n\nThe almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.\n\nEnter Ascensia Diabetes\n\nOn August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.\n\nAscensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?\n\nI believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google \"Blood glucose monitoring\" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.\n\nCurrently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.\n\nThe technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.\n\nWith FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.\n\nCurrently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.\n\nThe company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.\n\nSenseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels.

I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m not here to convince anybody to buy and I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m not here to say other stocks suck. Go ahead and promote your stock I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t give a shit. I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m simply stating what I believe is going to bare investors fruit soon. Great part is you don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have to hold through all the bullshit manipulation to capitalize.\n\nBefore diving in to why I think RKT is a huge buy right now there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s something that should be discussed before reading this.\n\nAll these \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3meme stocks\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 are posted when the stock is already up 50%. Your chances of losing money is very high when you buy those levels. The sub needs to understand how to buy low and sell high even though people pride themselves on losing money for some reason. I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t think RKT is a meme stock to be honest\u00d4\u00c7\u00aaand fuck that term. Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t mean it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a fucking meme stock. I get that this is a Wendy\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s, there are dumb asses, but dummies can make money too. I like the idea of buying/hold and averaging down, but yolloing OTM contracts on high volatility at all time highs it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s just throwing your money in the garbage. If you think that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s cool then fine -  do what you want I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t give a shit, but you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re not helping anybody but hedge funds. \n\nRKT is up 20% over the past two weeks. There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill. The thing is those shares have been getting brought up.\n\nThe only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons: one, Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15% discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership. This actually really helps the stock. Two, Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up. This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank. The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds. You can check my previous DD\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s for sources and more info. \n\nRight now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22.7. Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience. Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t go up 50% in 1 hour. Once they see where we are buying they won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t allow people to accumulate very long at those levels. What happens next is called a retest at 22.7. Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25. If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45,000 contracts for June 18 at 25. 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off. \n\nI believe the floor 18.5 or 19.5 so I would look to accumulate at now, 19.5, and then load up at 18.8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want. I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15% discount and Dan transferred shares at 16.8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15% above this level. \n\nNow I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play. Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe. This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth. They have yet to prove otherwise. Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300% in quarter one. Additionally rocket auto drops this August. I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know about you but I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing. Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle. Won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually. Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing. Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a totally different city now I have recently been there.\n\nOne thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand. I wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September. They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing. As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t make it work because if it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s one thing they know how to do it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s to market. Everyone wants the next big thing, you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll see commercials over and over again and eventually you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll actually see what rocket auto is about. When you see the platform you will hands-down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars. On top of that, they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll be the ones to provide you with the loan, they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll be the ones to profit off the sale. They don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car. They will fund it right to you. Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail.\n\nThe company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s still being valued as just a mortgage company. Institutions however aren\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed. You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up.\n\nIf you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know how you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll ever be convinced. That is not what they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re doing. What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field. Which is lucrative. \n\nCompanies like Amazon wish they could get into mortgages. Except it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s very difficult field to just enter. No one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it. Did you know that Lindsay gross gave a speech, He was Dan Gilbert\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s roommate in college at law school. He actually expressed Amazon had an interest in mortgages, this is when the company was private. After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t actually be able to be successful due to their business model. RKT got lucky and was at the right place at the right time. They merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue, thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing.\n\nPosition:  2600 shares @ 17.86 and 100 40.89s for 2023. I also have additional calls but I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t really like giving that information out because I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit.\n\nThis is not advice I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m just stating the facts. If you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re looking to enter a position I believe the stock will test 25 and possibly all time highs in the next few months. I believe by 2023 it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll be over 150 a share. I would buying share until iv dies down on options.\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is that leaps are crazy expensive right now. I wonder why. \n\nTLDR: rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very well-known products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice. This is not a mortgage play this is a value play. Don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t ever listen to any articles to justify price action that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s for the sheep. It just makes sense. All you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and I think you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll just see green moving forward. Below $20 a share won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be seen after September ever again imo.\n\nEdit: typos\n\nEdit 2: if you want to invest in a mortgage company then sure invest in both RKT and United whatever the fuck. If you want to invest in a mortgage and soon to be tech giant with massive growth and 194th richest company on Fortune 500 then invest in RKT. Idk about you but mortgages are boring. I like innovation. I like a company that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country. I like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over 10 years by JD powers.

The rationale for this is that the higher future earnings of these companies will not have as much purchasing power as a result of inflation. As a result, the market began to rotate into cyclical stocks that will do well in an inflationary environment because they have earning power right here, right now. With the whopping 5% inflation numbers that came out, the market has actually reversed the rotation into cyclical stocks in response. This to me, indicates that the market has priced in inflation based fears. I believe that this gives high growth stocks like WISH the green light to rally again.

The purpose of this analysis is to inform you about all of the ins and outs of Virgin Galactic, so that you can be confident and informed, think of it as doing your own Due Diligence. \n\n**Company Overview:**\n\nHere is a Statement from [SPCE\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001706946-21-000056/) that explains their mission and business, \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3We are a vertically-integrated aerospace company pioneering human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers, as well as a manufacturer of advanced air and space vehicles. Using our proprietary and reusable technologies and supported by a distinctive, Virgin-branded customer experience, we are developing a spaceflight system designed to offer customers, whom we refer to as \"future astronauts,\" a unique, multi-day, transformative experience. This culminates in a spaceflight that includes views of Earth from space and several minutes of weightlessness that will launch from Spaceport America, New Mexico. We believe that one of the most exciting and significant opportunities of our time lies in the commercial exploration of space and the development of technology that will change the way we travel across the globe in the future. Together we are opening access to space to change the world for good.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8\n\nVirgin Galactic is an Aerospace company that is among the first to enter into the commercial space flight industry. Virgin Galactic believes in the massive potential of space exploitation and monetization of commercial space flight and is positioning themselves to be a leader in the space (pun intended). The market for commercial space flight is a new concept that is yet to be explored, however there are a few other companies that are trying to break into this industry as well (i.e. [$LMT - Lockheed Martin](https://utradea.com/stocks/LMT)).\n\nIn the history of mankind, there have only been 581 humans to ever explore space. However, all of these people have been handpicked by [governmental space agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_space_agencies) and have been trained for many years. Virgin Galactic is trying to change this and make space flight available to high net-worth individuals (at the moment) so that these seemingly regular people have the chance to do something extraordinary and explore what space has to offer.\n\nThus far, Virgin Galactic has $80M in deposits from over 600 people, who are interested in using Virgin Galactic as a vehicle to explore space. Virgin Galactic is expecting to receive their last FAA approval needed to fly their customers in their aircrafts.\n\n**Investment Information:**\n\n*Commercial Space Flight Industry:*\n\nOver the past decade, space flight has been innovated consistently, through rapidly advancing technologies, decreasing costs, and greater access to capital for private space flight companies/organizations. Many governments have taken a hands-off approach to space flight and funded private companies who compete for contracts and are forced to be constantly innovating in order to win these contracts. This competition has resulted in technologies that greatly reduce the waste, emissions, and cost of space travel.\n\nVirgin Galactic has been able to incorporate the best innovations in space flight into their aircrafts to create a reusable rocket that increases launch consistency, number of launches, and decreases the cost of space exploration.\n\nLastly, Virgin Galactic is exploring certain strategic relationships in order to advance their technologies, identify new applications, accelerate their progress, and enhance their growth as a company.\n\n***Financial Information:***\n\n* **Financial Performance (Good):** Virgin Galactic increased their R&D expenses by 19% YoY, although this is considered a cost, it is necessary for their business to spend on R&D, and I believe the improvements in technology derived from R&D spending will be considered an asset in the future.\n* **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s revenues decreased by 93.7%, their gross profit decreased by 96.34%, their net loss increased by 199.79%, and their net margin decreased from 47% to 27%. This is due to the fact that the US government decreased their engineering service budget, having adverse effects on Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s business.\n* **Liquidity Position:** Virgin Galactic currently has a cash position of $665.9M (and an additional $13M of restricted cash). Having this many cash should help Virgin Galactic to weather the storm in the meantime until the eventually are able to have a positive net income.\n* **Stock-Based Compensation:** Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s board of directors, along with the shareholders adopted the 2019 Incentive Award Plan, which reserved 21.21M common shares to be awarded to employees, consultants, and directors. If these shares were to be distributed evenly over the next 3 years, there would be dilutionary effects of 2.85%/year.\n* **Director Compensation Table:** Virgin Galactic awards members on their board with stock awards, in 2020, Virgin Galactic gave out awards of $124,994 to 4 board members, totalling $500k of stock compensation. In Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s 10-K report they stated that this compensation resulted in a total of 99,465 shares distributed to these members. This would cause share dilution of around 0.04% which is essentially negligible.\n* **Anniversary Awards:** Virgin galactic also gave out some \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3anniversary awards\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 to some of their highest-ranking employees, to recognize their ongoing service. In 2020, they gave out 931,93 common shares to 4 of their longest-standing, high-ranking employees, this would cause share dilution of 0.4%, although this dilution is not a large figure it still adds up over time.\n* **Colglazier Awards:** In 2020, Virgin Galactic awarded their CEO \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 Michael Colglazier with a maximum of 1,070,000 in monthly installments over 60 months. This represents 214,000 shares being distributed to him every year, which would have a dilutionary effect of 0.09%/year.\n* **Palermo Awards:** Furthermore, in 2020, Virgin Galactic also awarded their COO, Enrico Palermo with a maximum of 200,828 shares, however upon retirement he only decided to take 25% (50,207 shares), which would cause a dilution of existing shares of 0.02%.\n* **Exercisable Options:** Currently, there are 717,603 underlying shares in options that are exercisable. If all of these options are exercised there will be dilutionary effects of around 0.3%, although this is not much it adds up.\n\n***Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s Strategy:***\n\nVirgin Galactic plans to use their proprietary and reusable flight system to seek to provide affordable, safe, reliable, and regular transportation to space for their customers. Virgin Galactic has highlighted a few ways in which they intend to achieve this:\n\n* **Commercial program for Human Spaceflight:** Virgin Galactic is in their final stages of readying their commercial spaceflight program and has been vigorously testing their [VSS Unity Spaceship](https://www.virgingalactic.com/mission/). Currently, they are happy with the performance and are completing the final touches, like adding a cabin interior, before they prepare their first future astronauts for space.\n* **Expanding their Fleet of Rockets:** Virgin Galactic plans to build more of their VSS Unity Rockets to expand their fleet of vehicles. Furthermore, they are working on building two SpaceShip III vehicles. By creating these vehicles, Virgin Galactic is hoping to increase their annual flight rate, which will help them to maximize their revenues.\n* **Lowering Costs:** Virgin Galactic is constantly looking for ways to improve their manufacturing and operating efficiency in order to decrease their total cost per spaceship. Furthermore, as they continue to manufacture additional spaceships and improve their technology, they believe that their costs will decrease smoothly over time.\n* **Leverage their Proprietary Technology:** Virgin Galactic intends to continue to expand on their proprietary technologies to pursue growth opportunities and enter into agreements with other government organizations for the use of their ships.\n\n***Management Team:***\n\nIt is very important to look at the credentials of the [management team](https://www.virgingalactic.com/who-we-are/our-team/), especially when looking at high growth stocks that have mainstream hype. Furthermore, this is increasingly important when looking at SPACs, or companies who previously were listed publicly via SPAC (like Virgin Galactic). By looking at the management team you get an idea of their experience and expertise in the field, which helps to validate the company and decrease the chances of a scam. (A great example of a SPAC with an awful management team is [$NKLA - Nikola](https://utradea.com/stocks/NKLA) and look at what happened to them).\n\n* Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s CEO was formerly the Chief of Staff at NASA and was the Space Shuttle Launch Integration Manager at NASA as well.\n* Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s President of Aerospace Systems has 20 years of experience in aerospace, defense, and cyber security industries.\n* Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s VP of Engineering had 40 years of experience working under Lockheed Martin.\n* Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s team of pilots has 269 years of combined flight experience with organizations like NASA, RCAF, RAF, US Air Force, and the US Marine Corps.\n* Furthermore, there are many distinguished members on Virgin Galactics Space Advisory board including former NASA Chief of Staff George Whitesides, and former astronauts Sandy Magnus and Chris Hadfield.\n\nI think that this management team is well-rounded, and very experienced. This is very good to see in a business as technical as Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s and it shows me the legitimacy of their business and their future potential. Furthermore, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a legitimate company who is making serious efforts to change space travel for all of mankind.\n\n***Competitors:***\n\nVirgin Galactic has competition both in the private space, and in the public markets. Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s private competition provides more of a threat to their operations/business, so I decided to include them. However, Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s public competitors are not as big of a threat, but I have to include them in this section because of the comparable analysis that is later to come.\n\nVirgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s private competitors include Space X, and Blue Origin, both of these companies (namely Space X) have made tremendous strides in the space travel industry and have made several advancements that have made space travel easier to access.\n\nVirgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s public competitors, are companies that operate similarly to Virgin Galactic, have similar goals for their business, and are listed on the public markets. These companies include [The Boeing Company ($BA),](https://utradea.com/stocks/BA) [Lockheed Martin Corp. ($LMT),](https://utradea.com/stocks/LMT) [Aerojet RocketDyne Holdings Inc. ($AJRD),](https://utradea.com/stocks/AJRD) and [Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. ($SPR).](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPR) These companies will be seen again in the comparable analysis, where I will compare the financial ratios and multiples of Virgin Galactic to that of these competitors.\n\n**Investment Valuation:**\n\nThe only way in which I could value Virgin Galactic is via comparable analyses. Furthermore, since there were only 3 multiple and/or ratios that exhibited a positive number, I had to choose to compare those ratios/multiples. The ratios/multiples that I chose were [P/B](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/price-to-book-ratio/), [PEG,](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamental-analysis-understanding-the-peg-ratio-3140796) and [EV/Assets.](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/ev-to-assets/)\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s P/B ratio against their public competitors (listed above in the \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3competitors\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 section of this report) I arrived at a fair value per share of $SPCE of $25.73, which implies a downside risk of 29.24%.\n\n*EV/Assets:*\n\nBy comparing Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s EV/Assets multiple to that of their public competitors, I arrived at an implied downside of 69.17%, or a share price of $11.21.\n\n*PEG:*\n\nThe last ratio that I examined was the PEG, which implied an upside of 14.99% to a share price of $41.81.\n\nAverage Comparable:\n\nIn order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I decided to take the average of the 3 results that I arrived at through my comparable analyses. By doing this, I got an all-encompassing fair value of $26.25/share, which would imply a downside risk of 27.80%.\n\nI do not think that this is the be all and end all for valuing $SPCE, because in this analysis I compared their ratios/multiples to other companies that were already more mature and were not solely focused on commercial space flight. An example of this is Boeing. Boeing has plans for space travel, however their business is generated through the sale of airplanes, this is vastly different from Virgin Galactic so the comparable does not make the most sense. So, although Virgin Galactic is not an undervalued stock today, they may be in the future when they make their own revenues.\n\nHowever, I do think that this valuation implies that current and potential investors should be aware of the risk and potential downside of this investment, however wherever there is risk, there is reward, and the reward for this investment could be astronomical (once again pun intended).\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* **Share Dilution:** Virgin Galactic has a lot of programs, and awards that incentivize their employees, and directors through stock compensation. These programs/awards include stock-based compensation, director compensation table, anniversary awards, Colglazier awards, Palermo awards, and exercisable option awards. By grouping all of this dilution into one figure, we arrive at a maximum dilution for the year 2020 to be 3.68%. This is a large number and should be considered by new and existing shareholders alike. However, this is a high growth potential investment, so it is not uncommon to have higher figures of dilution.\n* **Financial Performance:** Virgin Galactic\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s financial performance in 2020 was very poor, however it was due to the loss of contractual revenue from the US government. In the grand scheme of things, Virgin Galactic will not be relying on the US Government for the majority of their revenues, so it should not scare away investors from the bigger picture revenues for Virgin Galactic.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n* **FAA Approval:** If Virgin Galactic can get their last 2 approvals from the FAA, they can start to take their commercial space flight business seriously and start to generate their own revenues. Once they start generating their own revenues, they should be able to turn a profit and work towards overall profitability of the business.\n* **Successful Flights:** If Virgin Galactic can continue to have successful trials and flights, their reputation as a commercial space travel business will be solidified. This is especially important during the early stages of their business because trust is everything.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nGreat financials, strong leadership, and milestone accomplishments. SPCE is poised for continued growth if they can continued down this path.\n\n**Credit to** [**u/Lost-Guarantee229**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lost-Guarantee229/) **The Original Post (with pictures and graphs) can be found** [**here**](https://utradea.com/positions/60c212d524731e30f5a930a6)", "votes": 123, "post_title_sentiment": -0.0772, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9994, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 13:57:53", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:06:52", "reddit_post_id": "nwoate"}, "901": {"post_id": 15195, "author_id": 616899, "post_title": "I like green energy & greenback, CLNE has both what I like \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 141, "post_title_sentiment": 0.7269, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 22:23:29", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:06:53", "reddit_post_id": "nx0ak2"}, "902": {"post_id": 15196, "author_id": 614868, "post_title": "Me and $UWMC are taking our wives' sons and leaving this planet behind", "self_text": "", "votes": 143, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 20:23:18", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:06:54", "reddit_post_id": "nwxi1w"}, "903": {"post_id": 15197, "author_id": 563377, "post_title": "Secured $CLOV - Next Week Will Be HUGE!

People will want to take a smaller loan out, and use more cash, because inflation creates spending and high interest rates deter people from collecting debt. Housing prices are in a bubble right now due to low rates. That bubble will pop when rates rise. Rates will rise, inflation will rise, cash spending will rise, debt will lower, houses will sell cheaper. REITs will continue to yield great earnings and totally recover; big tendies.   \n\n\n\n\nMITT- [Pre-Covid=$16 Now=$4.4 (5.85% Short)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&display=&fromSearch=true&symbol=MITT)   \nIVR- [Pre-Covid= $18, Now=$4 (short 11.8%)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&display=&fromSearch=true&symbol=IVR)\n\n  \n\n\n\"I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t follow that logic, I think higher rates with inflation will cause a net no change to house prices\"\n\n -You don't think higher rates affect housing cost? \n\n \"Yes, higher rates usually drop home prices but wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t inflation pick it back up?\" \n\n-Inflation isn't considered *in the moment* the way rates are. Inflation takes 3months to two years for change to occur. When you get a quote for an interest rate, at max it'll last 3 months before you gotta pull a trigger\n\n-As inflation rises, people will have more cash to spend, which leads to more cash up front for down payment. Usually, a higher down payment = negotiation of lower house price.  \n-So, people will have both, more cash for down payment and a higher interest on a loan = perfect leverage for a lower price, this means a higher execution of sales... \n\n \"Wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t that create higher demand?\" \n\n-Demand is high right now, highest it has ever been. But, that doesn't lead to execution if the buyer isn't comfortable with the price. A lot of deals that have gone on this year failed to execute. This is usually because a homeowner sends in the inspector and lists some things to knock price down (which is typical) and the homeowner doesn't budge because they were only ever interested in selling for the ridiculously high prices other homes are selling for. House doesn't sell and homeowner ends up waiting for a better time in the market than in the middle of winter (when rates were lowest and demand was still growing)\n\n-Lower rates create higher demand. Demand is super high right now, another reason prices are ballooned too much. Demand cant get higher than where it is, so I believe it will go down when people get rates twice what they were 3 months prior. \n\n-My point being, the price will come down when it gets to brass and taxes. Houses will sell and people will be there to buy. REITs will still pull hefty profits and will recover.  \n\n\nTL;DR- Mortgage services and the real estate market over all has been unaffected. They still have great earnings and fundamentals will bring the cyclical investing back towards them. They will go up. I made this post a few months ago and have been heavy on all of these.

Obviously not. It was merged back in January with a SPAC run by Chamath Palihapitiya which is a guy known for supporting meme-rising stocks like GME and AMC. So P.P. Pretty much owns the company as far as I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m concerned.\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00f3 the inflation numbers that came out definitely hurt SPAC\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s in general, plus with a huge spike the price was coming down regardless. I sold most at the top and made great gains but depending on tomorrow if it drops lower I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m dropping everything back into it for longer term. \n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00f3 CLOV had a HUGE bullish bet from P.P. before the stock even exploded and the dude is known for merging private company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s with SPAC\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s, going public, and making profits. That was Jan and now we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re in JUNE.\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00f3 crayons and graphs tell me that this company was on its way up past $20 during the merge but there was in investigation started up about the company misleading investors. That being said, the company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s still didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t get shorted like the rest of these easy-to-short companies around the time. \n\n\nIf you\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve gotten this far congrats you can read and if you haven\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t here\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s the TLDR/summary: \n\nCLOV is undervalued being blow $20.

A few disclaimers: I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m a CPA in training with a Master\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s in Accounting from Bentley University, so I do thoroughly know how to read and interpret financial statements, and can layer in some technical/ratio analysis to back my opinions.\n\nI am fairly new to trading but am good at picking up chart trends and understanding how the bigger picture affects the daily stock price. With that said I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m still very much a newbie on valuations and the market as a whole. The other disclaimer is that I currently hold 12.5% of my portfolio in RKT and am considering 1.5-2x that position in the coming days.\n\nAllow me to first talk about the market conditions, then the health of the company itself, and then I will move to the stock.\n\nI\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been very torn about what to write in this part of my DD. A lot of people are wary of rising interest rates and decreasing demand in the future of the US housing market. While these woes are valid, I believe the Fed understands we are still far off from a full recovery. COVID-19 is still very prevalent across the globe, which will continue to put bottlenecks in supply chains and stretch out the full recovery. Investors are also short-sighted, so when RKT reported in their recent earnings that their GOS margin (gain-on-sale) will be lower than it was over the recent year, the stock tumbled.\n\nThis makes logical sense that it will be lower in the future, though, because we are coming out of a period of historical demand for mortgages and refinancing. Rocket even lays this out in their report, stating that their strong earnings over the last year clearly demonstrates how well-positioned they are in the market. With RKT diversifying its offerings (mentioned below), and the Fed unlikely to raise rates until at least late FY21-early FY22, these market woes don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t deter me from my bullishness.\n\nFundamentally RKT is an extremely strong company for a myriad of reasons (strap in). Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage is the largest non-bank retail lender in the country by a massive margin, more than 2x larger than the second (United Shore Financial). Non-bank lenders can offer more flexible loans than banks with lower down payment percentages. While bigger is not always better, one should simply look to a company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s customers and employees to determine long-term viability and market share retention/growth. Rocket Mortgage has been named #1 in the U.S. for Client Satisfaction in Mortgage Origination by JD Power for 11 years in a row, boasting a 91% customer retention rate and ranked 194 on the recent Fortune 500 list. Fortune ranks Rocket as #5 in their list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. They also offer employee discounts on mortgages which is an awesome perk.\n\nThe company is quite robust financially. $RKT brings a portfolio of offerings that give it huge competitive advantages, as well as a seemingly healthy balance sheet with increasing operating margins during a time where home ownership is at an all-time high (and average home prices have appreciated 3% YoY). Dan Gilbert, Rocket\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s cofounder and chairman, still owns 75%+ of the company, despite starting the company in 1985. He recently became the 36 th richest person in the world after Rocket\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s IPO. Together with the CEO Jay Farner, they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve kept Rocket/Quicken on the cutting edge of new technology: the company is investing heavily in new platforms to streamline the lending process and provide a full- service suite of products to their clients. Notably they reported a 220% increase (to 45,000 agents nationwide) in adoption of their Rocket Pro Insight platform which provides real estate agents with realtime updates on the status of their clients\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 mortgages and allows them to assist along the way.\n\nThey offer Rocket Auto \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 an automotive retail marketplace that pulled down $360 million in gross merchandise revenue for Q1. Amrock, an insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services company, just had its best quarter in history, with closings up 110% from last year. And RocketHomes.com, a fully integrated home search website, which had a mind-boggling increase of 300% to 1.5 million unique monthly visitors. Needless to say, this is a company that is operationally sound, growing exponentially with massive resources, loved by its customers, and takes care of its employees.\n\nThe company is focusing on growing its other revenue streams, building out its platforms, and grabbing more market share in an industry where it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s already dominating. There are plenty of press releases and news articles out about Rocket which is also a positive in my eyes, as I value transparency. I also like that they are a company that advertises a lot and has key partnerships and sponsorships as this further builds brand reputation. Switching gears to the actual RKT stock itself and valuation.\n\nThere are a myriad of reasons the stock is where it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s at today which I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll try to touch on, but in the last week I finally \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3got\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 it looking at the price action and putting the pieces together. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s here that I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll say I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m torn on the cost/benefit of RKT being a \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3meme\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 stock as it can lead to overselling/shorts piling on which we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve seen, but during current shifting bullish market conditions back towards small cap growth I do see this as a benefit. Again this is where brand reputation/name recognition helps immensely as it already has huge retail interest.\n\nThe primary reason I believe RKT to be undervalued at $20, other than what I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve mentioned previously, is the possibility of an addition of RKT to the S&P 500, and the recent addition to the Russell 1000 index. I won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t get into why this is be a massive deal for the stock, but I will discuss what brought RKT to this point. To be in the S&P a company needs to be US-based with market cap of $10B+, post 4 straight profitable quarters, and have 10%+ of public float. Basically RKT has \\~8% of its total company in Class A shares available to the public which has 100% of the economic interest, and the other \\~92% in Class D shares with more voting power but no economic interest, the vast majority of which Dan Gilbert owns and the rest for institutional investors and employees (seeing rumors of Hathaway buying a stake as Gilbert and Buffett are amigos, not confirmed). It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s TOTAL market cap is around $38B, with the publicly traded shares valued around $3B. Unfortunately, I have read that S&P will not allow new companies with more than 1 class of stock. Gilbert could convert all of the class D shares into class A to meet the S&P\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s criteria.\n\nIn my opinion, choosing to keep RKT structured as-is has proven beneficial as Gilbert and management have kept \\~70% of the voting rights because they believe they know how to steer the company best. So far this has worked quite well for them, as you don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t become the 36 th richest person in the world with an industry-leading company without steering through some tough waters. TLDR I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m fine with them not going in the S&P, but even being added to the Russell is a very bullish sign.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$RKT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/kon8hv7mcg471.jpg?width=1812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87736b6042af9551455b9faec2f11d2de5131c9e)\n\nThe stock has struggled to break the 50 MA but is recently coming off a breakout from the 10 MA on volume and \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3renewed retail interest in meme stocks\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8. In its short history the stock has traded mostly in this $19-24 channel but has tried and failed to breakout and hold multiple times.\n\nAt the most recent date I could find, RKT had a short interest of about 20 million shares out of 136 million outstanding, a 100% increase from the prior reported date. Also notice that nice cup and handle forming with solid support at $19.50, and a recent breakout in the last 2 days. I will admit I have NO idea what Rocket should be \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3worth\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 but based on its multiples it seems grossly undervalued at $20-22.\n\nIf you believe the company can continue even coming close to these growth metrics it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s trading under 10x forward P/E, which seems low for any industry, especially with the recent index rebalance of value/growth stocks. Now more anecdotally\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa\n\nI have read and heard of MANY bag holders of RKT when it was trading in its higher range and can confirm by looking at the option chain that there is far more open interest in ITM calls vs ITM puts, indicating that options traders are more bullish than bearish.\n\nI believe investors don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t fully understand what a quality company they have on their hands, with retail volatility in full effect and the shorts piling on to scare away the bulls creating heavy selling pressure. Bears clearly are wary of an over-inflated housing market and rising interest rates which will hurt their profitability, but I believe financially RKT will weather any such storm due to their market share and continued push towards revenue diversification.\n\n**\\*This is not financial advice and simply my own opinions.**", "votes": 94, "post_title_sentiment": 0.3612, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9994, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 14:56:22", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:07:09", "reddit_post_id": "nwpn7p"}, "918": {"post_id": 15212, "author_id": 307766, "post_title": "CLNE.

The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops.\n\nRead more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nArbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \\~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises. In the case of AMD, the average price target is some 30% over today's prices, so it should rocket.\n\n[https:\\/\\/public.tableau.com\\/app\\/profile\\/upndown\\/viz\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/gr9sro1mqg471.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fc21af702904945f5aa76ae8d7d85c1be4c3a84)\n\n**Possibility of Arbitrage ending soon**CEO Dr. Lisa Su has said many times that the acquisition will close by the end of the year. She's also always conservative in her estimates. Remember that she said revenue would increase by 37% in 2021, only to revise it in Q2 to 50% growth. Su, you sly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ligcuvdksg471.gif\n\nYou can track the regulatory approval status over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status/)\n\nThe US has already approved and Phase 1 of the approval process for the UK and EU will end on July 6th. If there are no objections, the acquisition is approved from them as well. There are not expected to be any objections. If there were any, they would go into Phase 2, which would end at the end of the year (Lisa's conservative timeline).\n\nThe big question is when will China approve? They're the last ones to give the approval. Well no one really knows when this is going to happen. In Oct. of 2020 AMD said they would be drafting a notification to SAMR (China). But that's really the last we heard of it.\n\nThere's a possibility that China will approve around the same time as the UK and EU, which could be as soon as July 6th. In that case,\n\n[butts](https://preview.redd.it/wsr44v9qlg471.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b9ec2b60f88b9b5443895e00486e98edfa63ef)\n\nAMD announced on May 19th that it was initiating a $4B stock buyback. And since then it appears that AMD has been buying back it's own stock in big chunks every day around 9:30-10am:\n\n[perdy](https://preview.redd.it/1cmdiz4fng471.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e1174f74f52798ea863caab6172b972d0698b6)\n\nThe doctor is smart. She knows the arb is keeping the stock down and aims to profit from it. The timing of the buyback may suggest that she thinks the approval is going to happen sooner than the end of the year.\n\nEither way, the stock will rocket once the approval happens. Could be in less than a month, if not, then it'll be end of year. Either way we're making tendies, it's just a matter of how soon. Place your bets!

Chamath looks for 10x trades, and has a good track record for spotting them. Most of WSB has a boner for this guy so I won't go into any more detail about him.\n\nWhat is SOFI? SOFI is a one stop shop fintech. They do:\n\n* Credit cards\n* Debit cards\n* Loans, including: Student, Personal, Mortgage, Medical, and Refinancing.\n* Stock investment\n* cryp toe trading\n* Insurance\n\nIt's a power house of a company, and the only one on the market to encompass all of these products.\n\nLet's start with the CEO, he's a no bullshit Wall Street guy. Because I'm a lazy fuck and my head hurts ill just copy and paste his bio from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Noto) :\n\n\"He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he was a star linebacker on the football team, earning All-East and Academic All-American honors. Noto was the highest-ranked mechanical engineering major in his graduating class. After graduating from Army Ranger School at Fort Benning, Noto served as a Communications Officer with the 24th Infantry Division in Fort Stewart, Georgia.\"\n\nHis most notable career accomplishments were becoming a managing director and then partner at Goldman Sachs, as well as becoming the CFO for NFL.\n\nThis guy doesn't fuck around. Go look at their Glassdoor listing and you'll see how employees describe the place as a Wall Street-esk environment and lacking the silicon valley hippie dippie vibe it portrays. Which I think is great for this growing company, I want these people to have their noses to the grind stone pumping their numbers up. And they are. Here are the Q1 2021 results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Q1 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ktqztjv3vf471.jpg?width=1199&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02313ad7f59e5112ab5542e37758464c0e0b4287)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Q1 2021](https://preview.redd.it/u0600vm4vf471.jpg?width=1198&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b284e8f40f93b990cb82d7a9e1c42aace6b7982)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbsolutely crushing it. By members they mean clients using their app. They want to make you feel as if you are joining a club, rather than a cog in a wheel, like every other bank.\n\nSince I know you retards can barely read, I'll add another picture from their original investor presentation, which shows their future growth expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/rha53be6vf471.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97f97de8811fa08aecc5e95e9fbc78e432c106e)\n\nNot only are their fundamentals solid, but the digital wallet sector is booming. Here's a snippet from ARK invests '2021 Big Ideas' :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ARK](https://preview.redd.it/kkaionb8vf471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2489266f02155b6f0464140e58800dd8f796fbf5)\n\nThis shit is gonna replace brick and mortar Bank branches. If BoA, Citi, wells fargo etc. don't keep their heads up they will be eating sofi's dust.\n\none last picture, which I think really represents Sofi's threat to large institutional banks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/wymdje59vf471.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd894883a4053b1c33ad9fce2d007b573808869)\n\nSofi is about to eat into the market share of these larger banks, because who wants multiple different accounts. In-fact according to their Investor Presentation: \"80% of consumers cite **inadequate One-Stop Shops** as the reason for >1 account\". Sofi is the only company to meet these consumers needs.\n\nAnd if that's not enough to make institutional banks worry, you should also consider the fact that they have almost no overhead. It's just an app. no brick and mortar branches, no employees to fill it, or insurance to cover it etc.\n\nThey also recently purchased Galileo for $1.2 billion, which is an API service with clients the like of Robinhood. I just listened to a podcast where the CEO of of Galileo says most of their clients are finance 'debit' based. So not only are they encroaching on institutional banks, but they are gunning for competitors within their sector by creating a larger moat.\n\nHm, what else did I miss:\n\n* They have a dope football stadium\n* Their app has a 4.8 out of 5 stars on a Apple's App Store\n* 55,000 in network ATMs with no withdrawal fees\n* Acquired over 2 billion dollars through the recent SPAC and PIPE investment\n* The CEO is fucking you girlfriend\n* It's undervalued at the current PPS of $22\n* Next upcoming catalyst is the approval of a bank charter\n* And for the degenerates, there is a good possibility of a short squeeze.  The current short interest is nearly 40%.\n\nMy personal target price is about $100 by the end of the year, hopefully by the end of the summer. but I'll probably sell and then it will just keep going to $200.\n\nThanks for reading, and go fuck yourselves.\n\nThis is not financial advice, and is meant purely for entertainment.", "votes": 80, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.6942, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 13:25:11", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:07:25", "reddit_post_id": "nwnles"}, "933": {"post_id": 15227, "author_id": 599078, "post_title": "A lesson in how to YOLO.

This is actually more important than if anyone has shorted it. SPY has high name recognition because it refers to the James Bond movie series, which everyone has seen.\n\nThen you declare a \u00d4\u00c7\u00ffshort squeeze\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 is possible. Again, it doesn't matter how much it's been shorted. I already declared that a SPY short squeeze is possible. So we are good here.\n\nLastly\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa You \u00d4\u00c7\u00ffshort squeeze\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 (*By buying tons of call options, which is actually a delta squeeze and then a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze SHHHHH*).\n\nYou may be thinking\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa what could be more idiotic that short squeezing the entire market? Is there a faster way to lose money? Didn't the SoftBank guy basically do this over the summer and lose $3 billion? The answers are of course \u00d4\u00c7\u00ffnothing\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6, 'no' and 'yes'.\n\n**But those thoughts don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t serve up confirmatory bias. So instead, here\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a list of things that may help you with confirmatory bias:**\n\n1. Tendies\n2. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s actually the SPDR, or Spider, S&P 500 ETF Trust. Spiders are vicious ambush predators, the type that would trap and feast upon the tendies of a hedge fund manager if they could.\n3. Citadel Securities, Melvin Capital, and \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3The Hedge Funds\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 have surely shorted this at some point, and I hear they aren\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t so popular around here.\n4. The short interest is 16%. That may not sound like a lot, but if 21% was good enough for AMC, surely 16% is close enough. More importantly, that is 362 BILLION DOLLARS of shares short. Even at its highest points, GME had something like 15 or 20 billion dollars short and the shorts had no choice but to cover. Even Stevie Cohen and Citadel can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t bail a bunch of hedge funds out of 362 billion dollars in an epic short squeeze of SPY! It would take a fed intervention, and they never do stuff like that.\n\nBut it gets even better! S&P 500 futures trade in arbitrage (fancy word for \u00d4\u00c7\u00ffsame way) against SPY, and there are currently bout 2.8 million of those outstanding. Each one is $210k, so this is another $588 billion dollars of exposure\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa and because each one technically has a long end and a short counterparty, it is in a way 100% short. Wow!\n\nAND IT GETS EVEN BETTER. Because this ETF contains all companies of the index, you ALSO get to squeeze any shorts inside of that! You literately will be able to squeeze a good part of all shorts globally. That'll really show them!\n\nHere's visual DD to help those who are illiterate but can still trade derivatives contracts. The rest of you are craving it too:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryu3tgg12j471.png?width=201&format=png&auto=webp&s=3070f907e3a6b3ba112a57800aba3a73ba3f799f\n\n**Risks:**\n\nAside from the fact that this is an incredibly stupid idea that you should not try to do under any circumstances, I am aware of a few risks:\n\n1. The hedgies will play dirty and do what is called a \u00d4\u00c7\u00ffshort ladder\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 attack. This consists of them going to home depot, buying a foot ladder, and swinging it in a low motion at your shins. It also makes your stock prices go down. I recommend buying cowboy boots to defend against this.\n2. The hedgies also can do 'naked shorting'. This is when they take off their clothes and dump ES futures which banks will buy and then hedge by dumping SPY. The countermeasure to this is to put sharks in their pool, since they usually do this while at their mansion in Florida, and swim afterwards, since they already took their clothes off. Paul Tudor Jones used to trade SPUs (big sized version of ES) while drinking, so I assume modern hedge fund managers are the same, so they won't notice the shark because they are tipsy, and will end up margin called since they won't be able to manually close their trade.\n3. You guys will get distracted by a struggling retailer or mattress company or health care company under sec investigation or purveyor of lethal intelligence or something.\n\nPositions: I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll buy some SPY calls tomorrow in solidarity and because I like to be excited about the stock market over the weekend.

At this very moment they supply **THE** **WHOLE PLANET** (excluding Antarctica I think) with **TOP OF THE LINE SOLAR JUICE**. They are literally **milking** the sun.\n\nBoring stuff first to get it over with? Sure\n\n**1: Technical Analysis**\n\nTA is like astrology for \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8rational grownups\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8, it works until it doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t. Still we can deduce certain developments and in the end only need to trick the algos. So here is a picture\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cwojf3sug471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=978b4f6e2b8c382247dacf8b28c37546e57f22b1\n\nWhat is this shit and what does it mean?\n\nThe top picture shows the most recent downtrend, **WHICH JUST GOT FUCKING BROKEN** and the, still valid older downtrend from mid last year. The top red line is the next target, which would be \\~ 60$ or almost 50% above current shareprice. If this gets broken too there are clear skies ahead, which is always good for solar \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u2557.\n\nThe second picture is the MACD, ~~which means Macdonalds~~, which basically means when the line moves from below the center to above the center it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a bullish signal. Since this just seems to be occurring one could speculate that this will start a **MASSIVE BONKERS BULLRUN**.\n\nThe last picture is the RSI and I included it because it looks pretty.\n\nAre you bored yet? It gets worse before it gets better.\n\n**2: THE NUMBERS MASON WHAT DO THEY MEAN**\n\nJust looking at numbers alone won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t give you a good indication if a stock is performing well, is undervalued yada yada. Nice boy that I am I compared some metrics between Jinko and competition for you, in Excel like the **fucking nerd I am**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzzipat5vg471.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0cd1c824df9c9ccb8a5aa9274381fba9533f5b\n\nAs you may have noticed, Jinko **ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS** those 2 other guys in sales but is a **LITTLE BITCH** when it comes to profits and market cap. Why is that, am I retarded for recommending this bullshit to you? *Maybe.*\n\nThen again, a closer look to the expenses reveal that most of the sales-money goes to SG&A, which is just administrative overhang in a company, think of salespeople, the janitor, the low level support who watches stocks all day on their phone. Why do they have so much of these? **BECAUSE THEY ARE ON LITERALLY EVERY CONTINENT ON THE EARTH.** Seriously, look it up. Australia, Middle-East, Asia, Europe, Africe, both Americas. They have locations everywhere. And customers are pleased, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll tell you that.\n\nYou know who else expanded everywhere aggressively in their history? It starts with A and ends with 1 day delivery. The other problem is that Jinko relies heavily on materials for producing, especially silicone. I think you know that this shit is expensive right now. So what do they do? Like the **GIGACHADS** they are they are actively acquiring mining companies so they don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have to pay stupid premiums.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izpet1cdvg471.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=066908e318a77a46a964cbb9a7326e7375321850\n\n**THEY ARE VALUED AT NOT EVEN HALF THEIR SALES! YOU CAN'T FIND THIS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE SOLAR SECTOR**\n\n**3: BULLCASE**\n\nSo what\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s next for Jinko, why would the stock rise at all? I already talked about expansion and being independent from material producers. Let me tell you about something going on in the heart of europoor country, Germany.\n\nChances are high, that \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3Die Gr\u251c\u255dnen\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8, which literally translates to \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3The Greens\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8, a german political party which is all about protecting the environment, will be elected into government this summer. There are laws in the making which would force every homeowner to install solar panels on their roofs. Why is this important for Jinko? There are virtually no solar panel manufacturers left in Germany since the big solar bust some years ago, so we are dependant on foreign goods on this one. And since Jinko has the best performing modules and already has a strong presence and network in Europe, they will get a big slice of that juicy cake.\n\nNext let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s look at their products, the panels themselves. **AT THIS VERY MOMENT** you can buy the world\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s #7 panel from Jinko regarding efficiency at 20,2% for 0,76$ / W. Compare that to #1, which has a measily 2,2% more efficiency for DOUBLE the price. Are they stupid? That\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s not all though, Jinko recently achieved a whopping 25,25% efficiency on their upcoming product line. You heard that right, we can soon suck off daddy sun for 1/4th of his output **( \u2550\u00ed\u252c\u2591 \u2550\u00a3\u2569\u00fb \u2550\u00ed\u252c\u2591)**.\n\nLet\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s not forget sleepy joe on this one. He promised a fat green deal. I bet my left asscheeck that solar will be included.\n\nThey recently appointed a new CFO, who himself has an extensive record in the solar industry. He worked at Canadian Solar (which is also a good stock to look at). They did that to prepare for the STAR listing which is basically the NYSE in Shanghai. Chinese people have very limited access to the stock markets, now they can get in on this beautiful dragon.\n\n**4: BEARCASE**\n\nI am not here to deceive you precious donkeys. No DD is complete without looking at the dark side.\n\nThere is obviously the **CHYNA** Factor at play here. Go watch \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3The China Hustle\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 if you want to know why Wallstreet is shy when it comes to Chinese stocks. It doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t really apply to Jinko since they are not just a doghouse in the middle of nowhere valued at millions, but psychology is a bitch. Also, trade wars, cold wars, hot wars, world of warcraft is all on the table. What troublesome times we live in.\n\nNext is the issue with slave labour. There are concerns that parts of the materials used are extracted in regions where the Uyghurs are abused and mistreated and possibly used as modern slaves. I am not there and can neither verify or deny those claims but its good to keep in mind.\n\nAlso stock market doing stock market things. You never know.\n\n**5: SAY THE LINE BART**\n\nI am hesitant to use it, but it is what it is. Guess who is short on the biggest, badassest Solarpanelmanufacturer on the planet? Our favourite hedgeguy.\n\nYFW you find out who is messing around again\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9lxer5qvg471.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f17567768eeabcfca211dc8447ac8222e19b319\n\nI hope I didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t bore you to death. I don't want this to be the next P&D. In my opinion there is just gigantic upside which has so far been overlooked by the \"\"efficient Market\"\".

But beyond the 'real or fake' dichotomy, the essential product is the same.\n\n* The product is the simplest story of all - me you fight ooga booga. \n* Both companies are monolithic America-based entities that the average consumer conflates with the product itself. People 'train UFC' and refer to indie wrestlers as 'doing WWE'. \n* Both companies operate premium-priced streaming services for additional over-the-top content beyond their television offerings (WWE Network vs. UFC Fight Pass). \n* Both companies offer tertiary programming on multiple channels featuring their promoted stars.\n* Both companies boast lucrative television contracts.\n* **Small Time Vs. Big Time**\n\n**Many Bananas**\n\nThe UFC sold for $4 billion in 2016 (about $4.5 billion today) and many tendies showered upon the Fetitta brothers, who had purchased the ailing organization for a mere $2 million in 2001. At the time, the price seemed rather high, particularly considering the interest payments due on the investment that crimped fighter pay and sponsorship deals. Nevertheless the organization remained successful and has seen its estimated value increase considerably during the interim.\n\nSpeaking as a lifelong fan of professional wrestling *and* a longtime mixed-martial arts fan, there's no comparison when it comes to the product. The WWE is just *bigger.*\n\n**Big Time Wrestling**\n\nThe WWE is just bigger. Bigger television deals. More airtime. More viewers. More shows. More content. Content, content, content.\n\nThat's why NBC backed up the Brinks truck for the big WWE pay-per-view deal that saw the WWE sign over their American WWE Network subscribers to consume their content on Peacock TV instead. The [$1 billion 5-year deal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/how-the-dollar1-billion-wwe-network-deal-puts-peacock-into-the-ring-with-streaming-giants/ar-BB1d5ous) for WWE Network content is separate from the [$1 billion 5-year deal](https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/wwe-fox-deal-worth-one-billion-dollars/) with Fox for WWE Smackdown and the [separate 5-year deal with USA](https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-confirms-new-tv-deal-with-usa-network-and-fox-sports) for Monday Night Raw and NXT on Tuesday nights. Apparently Vince likes billion-dollar deals, who knew. (If someone has figures for the USA deal, please enter in the comments.)\n\nAt the time of the UFC's sale, the UFC was still working through its [original deal with Fox](https://heavy.com/mma/mma-news/2011/08/ufc-fox-announce-new-television-deal/), which consisted of 24 The Ultimate Fighter fights and 6 live UFC Fight Night events. This would comprise about 40 hours worth of programming per year. Currently, the WWE produces a staggering: \n\n* 260 hours of top-line content per year - weekly Monday Night Raw (3 hours) and WWE Smackdown (2 hours) shows, generally drawing 1.5-2 million viewers per show. T\n* 156 hours of B-level content, including 2 hours of NXT (650,000 viewers per show) and 1 hour of 205 Live (not many, unfortunately).\n* 40 hours of 'pay-per-view' content per year.\n\nRemember, these are American viewers only - global viewing audience is considerably higher.\n\n**Revenues**\n\nDana White must have made a deal with the devil, because the UFC's 2016 revenue came to $666 million. WWE's 2020 revenue came to a staggering [$974 million](https://corporate.wwe.com/~/media/Files/W/WWE/annual-reports/2020-annual-report.pdf) in the midst of a pandemic, itself suggesting a deal of at least $7 billion for the company. For comparison's sake, the WWE's current market cap is just shy of $5 billion. However, I believe $7 billion is a lowball estimate. To wit:\n\n* The UFC at the time relied heavily on individual pay-per-view sales to drive revenue, The UFC's comparable reliance at the time on superstar fighters such as Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey meant their big numbers could not be relied upon.\n* Meanwhile, the WWE presently relies on long-term guaranteed television contracts and premium-streaming revenue.\n* The advent of on-demand and streaming services have given leeway for the stratospheric rise of television rights fees for live sports in the last several years.\n\nI would be very surprised if the WWE went for anything less than $10 billion and I would assume closer to $12 billion. A $12 billion sale price would price $WWE at $157/share, considerably up from $64.57 today and making many gorillas happy with their bananas.\n\n**Unusual Corporate Moves**\n\nThe fact that WWE recently released a lot of talent isn't news in and of itself. The company has historically performed a 'spring cleaning' of sorts every year after their Wrestlemania event, where dozens of wrestlers are given a wristwatch and a kick in the butt on the way out the door, daddy. However, there are a few key differences this year:\n\n* By all appearances, the WWE did not exactly fight hard to keep one of their absolute top stars in Daniel Bryan, whose contract expired shortly after Wrestlemania. \n* While a lot of talent released post-Wrestlemania were either underutilized roster fillers or underutilized but talented midcarders, a number of releases this year raised eyebrows. Among the odd ones out:\n   * Samoa Joe, beloved wrestler-turned-commentator\n   * Mickie James, beloved veteran women's wrestler\n   * BRAUN STROWMAN, the titanic former world champion with a big-dollar contract\n   * Aleister Black, who had just been re-introduced and featured in the main event of WWE Smackdown not two weeks prior to his release\n* Perhaps even more importantly, there was the matter of the [merging (involving multiple layoffs) of two separate media departments](https://www.mandatory.com/wrestlezone/news/1236661-wwe-merges-digital-and-tv-departments-amid-many-layoffs). \n\nCombined, these to me look as if the WWE is cleaning shop both internally and on the surface level to prep itself for a sale. Releasing high-dollar talent and extraneous roster guys will give new owners a clean slate to work with, and if they want someone back, they can always try to get them back (including Strowman, I would assume). Corporate downsizing makes the books look better.\n\n**Vince Being Vince**\n\nVince McMahon's uniquely monomaniacal approach to the WWE creative process extends to his entire business approach. The ultimate alpha male gorilla/ape/whatever, Vince is the last word on all creative decisions in the business. Whatever happens on his show, happens for a reason. Until recently, he even sat in the [gorilla position](https://www.ringsidenews.com/2020/08/21/vince-mcmahon-hasnt-sat-at-gorilla-position-backstage-in-wwe-in-quite-some-time/) during televised events. (It's a thing, yes.)\n\nIt takes a lot of energy to run, book and manage a wrestling promotion, even a small regional one. And while Vince has often bragged about his virility and even [posed for the cover of Muscle and Fitness](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6c/f1/e1/6cf1e1897b84ff75c63f5da38cef8986--fitness-magazine-vince-mcmahon.jpg) at the age of 69(!), he's getting OLD. Now 76 years old, Vince McMahon has made only sporadic and brief television appearances. \n\nIn my opinion Vince is looking to put a capstone rather than a headstone on his legacy--and one way to do that is to take his father's modestly successful wrestling promotion and permanently cement it as an unarguable business success by selling it for an obscene amount of money.\n\n**That's The Bottom Line**\n\nI think the WWE is setting the table for an acquisition and I believe the eventual acquisition price will be considerably above the market cap. I believe the true acquisition value of the company is north of $10 billion, perhaps as high as $15 billion, for an eventual range of $131-$197/share.\n\nApe out.", "votes": 48, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9977, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 14:42:05", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:07:56", "reddit_post_id": "nwpb0y"}, "966": {"post_id": 15260, "author_id": 618116, "post_title": "Catalyst: Upward Health Announces Contract with Clover Health to Serve Patients In Four States Under New Direct Contracting Initiative", "self_text": "", "votes": 50, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 15:44:55", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:07:58", "reddit_post_id": "nwqtkg"}, "967": {"post_id": 15261, "author_id": 206737, "post_title": "Yolo! $CLOV \u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00aa\u00ec\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00f2\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4\u00ad\u0192\u00d6\u00ee", "self_text": "", "votes": 54, "post_title_sentiment": 0.3382, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 22:18:57", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:07:59", "reddit_post_id": "nx06uy"}, "968": {"post_id": 15262, "author_id": 615799, "post_title": "Holding strong \u00ad\u0192\u00d6\u00ee\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00a2\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4\u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00d8", "self_text": "", "votes": 51, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5106, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 20:16:01", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:07:59", "reddit_post_id": "nwxbyq"}, "969": {"post_id": 15263, "author_id": 608949, "post_title": "Interstellar: a $SPCE Story \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00f8\u00a9\u00ad\u0192\u00f8\u2591\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 51, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 19:17:42", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:01", "reddit_post_id": "nwvxp2"}, "970": {"post_id": 15264, "author_id": 614396, "post_title": "Diamond nuts $CLOV", "self_text": "", "votes": 51, "post_title_sentiment": 0.0258, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 14:13:56", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:02", "reddit_post_id": "nwonrf"}, "971": {"post_id": 15265, "author_id": 605654, "post_title": "Amazon and Alibaba have approached 5-year-old startup Wish, but the CEO seems to want more than $10 billion", "self_text": "", "votes": 54, "post_title_sentiment": 0.3919, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 19:50:35", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:03", "reddit_post_id": "nwwper"}, "972": {"post_id": 15266, "author_id": 613269, "post_title": "Loss porn $wish", "self_text": "", "votes": 45, "post_title_sentiment": -0.3182, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 14:56:10", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:04", "reddit_post_id": "nwpn1m"}, "973": {"post_id": 15267, "author_id": 618123, "post_title": "Not selling \u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00c4\u00ad\u0192\u00d6\u00ee\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00a5", "self_text": "", "votes": 49, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 16:01:57", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:05", "reddit_post_id": "nwr81x"}, "974": {"post_id": 15268, "author_id": 11637, "post_title": "Is The SEC Investigating GameStop because of Foul Play By Short Sellers?", "self_text": "", "votes": 46, "post_title_sentiment": 0.34, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-10 10:42:20", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:06", "reddit_post_id": "nwkgpq"}, "975": {"post_id": 15269, "author_id": 617605, "post_title": "WKHS - Buy the Rumor USPS One More Time?

It is June and the horse is running just like it did 12 months ago when it went from penny stock to over $20 faster than Man O' War ever could run. Today we have a more mature company with over 8,000 trucks on back order and a drone unit that has tested succesufuly 45 out 45 times. That makes me think at $2 Billion which it trades at is already a value to its peers (NKLA $7 Billion Market Cap - Arrival $11 Billion - and Rivian rumored to IPO at $70 Billion).\n\nThe big honey pot, of course, was always the USPS deal which was shockingly given to Osh Kosh Defense in a deal that has drawn heavy scruntiy. If you read the press release closely, you notice that OSK has only been awarded $450 million of the deal so far and even more oddly it is a rendering of a truck that has never been tested. Qualified bidders all put vehicles through rigirous USPS testing in various terrain, climate and durabity in the finalist stage. USPS picked a rendering after a half decade of making companies go through all the hoops and ladders. There were three finalist. Workhorse Group, OSK, and Morgan Olson who was partnered with Turkish company Karsan who had a hybrid vehicle that was bypassed.\n\nA month ago, Workhorse announced a partnership deal with a new subsidary of Olson called EAVX. During the earnings call the day of the announcement, Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes kept reffering to a \"Next Generation Delievery Vehicle\" the two companies were working together on but didn't expand much further on the product. It was intersting terminology as the USPS contract was for a \"Next Generation Delievery Vehicle\". Morgan Olson has been working on USPS trucks for four decades and took over Grumman who did the USPS trucks currently in use you see today.\n\nToday it was announced that the infrastructure bill has been agreed to and in that bill there was an allotment for $12 Billion for USPS to transition to EVs. Were these two companies told to partner to come up with parts that then could be brought to OSK to do final assembly? Workhorse would provide the chassis, Olson would do the frame, and OSK would mesh the two together. It is definetly a possibilty.\n\nOSK stated in their SEC filing in the fall that they were behind in EV development so could use a partner if USPS wants to transition to a full EV fleet now that the funds are available for them in this bill. It would also play well in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan (all battleground states) getting a piece of a giant government contract and employ thousands of workers in those battleground states.\n\n(Author:  [u/clevelandleader](https://www.reddit.com/user/clevelandleader/))", "votes": 100, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.1664, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 02:32:26", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 00:08:06", "reddit_post_id": "nx5756"}, "976": {"post_id": 15270, "author_id": 616963, "post_title": "Not selling.

I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat x4 times more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger TAM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**V.VII -** **Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 PNH patients***, *12* of them using *Ultomiris* and the other *11* *Soliris.* The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zesa1of5g471.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05e7574c33145be90082457208ccb6b1e20a2f0\n\nSome of the *patients treated with BCX9930* were asked some questions, among them, the *6th* one expressed his ***desire*** *to be able to* ***be treated with BCX9930 twice a day oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are *highly willing to* ***switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzw3kecg5g471.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba01832e166c0a08bbbbf6895c3656ebc4336c1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**V.VIII - BCX9930 Valuation**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving in mind BCX9930 is a *the* **B*****est-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their C5 inhibitor, and the yearly ***market size*** BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the ***$40B*** mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B*** *meaning* ***66.44$.***\n\n*Same thing as with Orladeyo happens here. BCX9930 is an Orally taken treatment, the other approved treatments out there requiere usage of Needles, so we shoud expect BCX9930 to follow Orladeyo's steps or perhaps perform even better, now that the company has gained valuable experince with the launch of Orladeyo.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/kbavdtth5g471.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2e4af6b7ff8e625e1949a82fe8603034bf82de3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing *strong conviction* in the company.\n\nSince Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him ***5 months to close the buy out deal***, as shown in the picture below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqvj6maj5g471.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=075d8d0286936a5a94979d55fc3a69d8b2606df2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this exhaustive analysis of the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a *strong BO candidate*. A Buy Out coming from **Biogen** ***BIIB***, company *where* ***Denner*** *forms part of the* ***BOD*** *board of directors*, would make total sense ***in the following 1-2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled. BIIB's financial position in the last year has notoriously worsened, the profitability has gone down a -71.25% in the last year. They need new revenue sources and BCRX's excellent pipeline could change so. **Takeda** ***TAK*** could be another excellent suitor for the BO, considering how Orladeyo is stealing its HAE patients market share.\n\nIt also is important to mention that ***Bank of America*** *added BCRX to the list of* ***top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020.

Alexion's performance with Soliris**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we should expect from Biocryst in the upcoming years. *From* ***2007 to 2014*** *Alexion's* ***SP grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$*** *in* ***2007*** *and* ***186.6$ in 2014.***\n\nRevenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their C5 inhibitor was approved to treat additional diseases firstly PNH then aHUS, as the market size it captured became wider and the amount of patients it treated slowly scored up\n\nBiocryst Pharmaceutical's SP managing to do the SP move Alexion's stock did, is more than ***doable*** considering the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind *Alexion made* ***66.4 MM*** *revenue the first year (2007) while* ***BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenues generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bl4rfklm5g471.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=398203d44c761ee998807f49668909f1f4277b8c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **7.** **De-risked company**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a **Royalty** ***agreement*** *with* ***Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000*** *in order to support Orladeyo launch*.\n\n***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.***\n\nIt's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13etg1mo5g471.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3364872ddb4162ff31bdf6ddf3c044fef8cfff\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **8.

Conclusion**\n\nAfter this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. PT will keep growing as we get new data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, potentially making it have the ***Best Risk/Reward ratio in the Bio-Sector.*** I naturally do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range.

I've been following this company ever since. This was before the Amazon partnership I believe but check this out... \n\n**What and who is Clean Energy Fuels Corp?**\n\nThe company is THE leading provide of the cleanest fuel, Natural Gas, for the transportation market in the United States and Canada. They primarily focus in on:\n\n1. Regional Fleets of Trucks\n2. Heavy Duty Trucking\n3. Airport Transit\n4. Public Transit\n5. Construction Vehicles\n6. Waste Management Vehicles (Dump trucks)\n\nIt\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s products consist of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). One of its leading products is something called Redeem, which is a form of renewable natural gas (RNG), won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t bother getting into how it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s composed, but know that it provides up to 70% reduction in greenhouse gasses versus diesel and gasoline. Redeem itself is made from organic waste from landfills and farms.\n\n**Natural Gas**\n\nThere has been a lot of stigma around what it really means to be \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3clean\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 or \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3green\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 when it comes to transportation; most of us think that Electric Vehicles seem to be the most green product for transportation out there. EV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s are definitely the future, I just want to state that before getting started spewing out more information, but RNG has huge demand and can definitely lead the way for clean energy. The company itself reduced 745,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and more than 401,000,000 gallons were sold in 2019.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but how clean is natural gas? Based only minimal research, it looks to be cleaner than the \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3electric truck\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 provided by companies like $HYLN.\n\n**Emission Comparison:**\n\n1. Natural Gas Truck - Produces 0.02g/bhp/hr of NO\n2. Electric Truck - Produces 0.07g/bhp/hr of NO\n3. Diesel Truck - Produces 0.2g/bhp/hr of NO\n\n**Financials & Valuations (as of 9/30/2020):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/8/2021) - $2.032B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $70,886,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $216,766,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 3 months: ($2,539,000) \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 Down from ($5,375,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 9 months: ($8,677,000) \u00d4\u00c7\u00f4 Down from ($25,964,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $91,605,000\n\nThe financials of Clean Energy are not very special, yes they have a high PE ratio, but in this market, really anything is possible. The point is the opportunity, with Biden supplementing a lot of stimulus into the clean energy market, Clean Energy Fuels Corp is poised to get a large piece with it being such a staple within the Natural Gas industry.\n\n**Partnerships & Programs:**\n\n**1.** **Chevron**\n\nChevron partnered with CLNE on July 8th, 2020 with the announcement of the **Adopt-a-Port program**. This will allow fleets across North America to subsidize costs transitioning into a greener product for transportation with cost advantages. Chevron will provide funding for Adopt-a-Port and supply RNG to Clean Energy stations near the ports. Chevron\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new RNG-powered trucks. Clean Energy, meanwhile, will manage the program, including offering fueling services for qualified truck operators.\n\n**2.** **Total SE**\n\nTotal is a very large company focusing in refining petroleum. They are the largest shareholder of CLNE @ 26% of outstanding shares. Again, a large company partnering with CLNE to produce revenues in the current year and future years. With Total SE, they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve partnered with CLNE in a joint venture (valued at around $145 million) to launch the Zero Now Program. The **Zero Now Program** allows companies to purchase a natural gas truck for the same price as they could buy a diesel truck; in the combined deal, they would also offer a discount for fuel up until an agreed time to help persuade the companies to go greener.\n\n**3.** **BP**\n\nThe third partner is BP, CLNE recently announced that it will work with BP to develop, own, and operate RNG facilities at dairies and other agriculture facilities that will produce Redeem. The deal is quite small but could mean big things if the partnership were to be progressed through time.\n\n**4.** **Waste Connections**\n\nWaste connections is the 3rd largest waste collections company in North America, based on market cap, they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re currently worth around $40B. They\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve been a partner with CLNE for years, and have recently promoted one of their regional fleets of dump trucks to RNG vehicles, and will begin operating with Redeem as soon as possible. The fleet consists of 110 trucks in the San Jose area. The deal itself isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t that great, I must admit, but this could mean big things as if the trial goes well in the San Jose area, this could mean upgrades to their regional fleets across the United States and possibly into Canada.\n\n**5.** **Republic Services**\n\nAnother large company with a long partnership history with Clean Energy Fuels Corp. In February 2019, they announced that they will utilize increasing amounts of Redeem fuel across 21 states over the next 5 years, and this is in process. This transition to cleaner fuel will represent 250,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emission reduction each year, which translates to around 53,000 passenger vehicles to be taken off the road.\n\n**Summary of Partnerships & Programs**\n\nThese partnerships will continue to provide Clean Energy Fuels Corp. with recurring revenues to drive growth across North America. Their recent and past partnerships continue to give rise to increasing demand of natural gas in one of the largest industries that demands fuel of this nature. The programs in place: Zero Now & Adopt-a-Port program were introduced and will drive growth in the industry by providing incentives to adopting RNG vehicles instead of gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. There are a lot of advantages to adopting Redeem:\n\n* 70% reudction in greenhouse gases\n* Cost efficient - offered at $1.00/gallon.\n* Renewable\n* Domestic - Moving North America towards energy independence.\n\n**Growth & Opportunities**\n\nWith most of the world in lockdown, and the rise of eCommerce and the need for shipping and delivery services, this will drive the demand for their Redeem product. Companies like UPS, Kroger, FedEx and Republic Services have already signed up for large deals to use the product as a substantially lower cost then Diesel or Gas. The cost of Redeem is $1.00/gallon to give you perspective. Volume growth for their Redeem Product in the past 3 years averaged 34.67% growth; and this was before the Pandemic.\n\nThe Heavy-Duty Truck industry is one of the largest markets for fuel consumption, and so the opportunities are endless to gain more market share as governments are demanding for greener transportation. The Heavy-Duty trucing industry demands 35 billion gallons of fuel, 30 billion over any other market in the big-rig industries.\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities for future advancement throughout the space by making partnerships that will be mutually beneficial for both the world, CLNE, and the company involved. Companies that currently use Natural Gas for their national fleets include: Honda, FritoLay, FedEx, Anheuser Busch, Verizon, Bimbo, J&J, Waste Management, Republic Services, Home Depot, Lowes, AT&TT, Costco, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo, UPS, HP, Unilever, Starbucks, Amazon, Kraft, Kroger, and McDonalds. These companies are large, and there is huge potential for future partnerships with them.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nYou may be asking yourself: \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s not really that impressive, why should I invest?\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 Well, the recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. Government\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s are transitioning to non-gas related vehicles and this will continue to be progressed for years to come. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.\n\nThe CEO owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nSome people may be curious of my price targets for CLNE. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s been on an absolute tear recently, so I apologize for the late post, but this is just the beginning! My conservative price target is $20 by June 2021, $40 by end of 2022; this is pretty much guessing lol, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nDo your own due diligence before investing, this is just my personal opinion on the company, and this is not financial advice of any kind!

I intend to become rich off of this company.\n\n# This week was crazy. Do you want to make more money? Are you tired of endless shart sqioizle squirt trash comments? Do your wives have DDs?\n\n**If any of these apply to you, then keep reading.**\n\n\\*\\*CLF is still primed and ready to launch, but let me introduce you to his Mexican brother $TX (Ternium).\\*\\*\n\n# Where and what the fuck is TX?\n\nDown in the lands of strippers, cocaine and cartels, TX produces flat steel and uses its own version of cocaine, coal coke.  Ternium is Latin America\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s largest producer of flat steel and makes **more than all of Yanksteel (American Steel) combined**.\n\nConsumer goods production has continued to increase in Mexico over the past 25 years with post-corona recovery already in play.\n\n[Mexico is back in business](https://preview.redd.it/efynva3dbk471.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3c4cc4c518c61343e06abb071618d12e1070ce)\n\n# Ternium & Tech:\n\n[Both methods EAF and BF allow for multilevel steel production for all the lambos and shit that you want.](https://preview.redd.it/drxs6s5gbk471.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a9c949787566f94d7264c198445c58309260aaa)\n\nTX takes advantage of more technologically advanced steel production methods that a lot of other companies including Yanksteel. After shamelessly stealing this image from u/JayArlington we can see a few different things. Using Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) **and** Blast Furnaces, TX maximizes steel production output. EAFs use scrap metal while Blast Furnaces directly cook iron ore to make steel that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s harder than your dicks when you see a \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3sHarT sQuEeZe\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 post.\n\nAdditionally, TX can be considered vertically integrated as they have a business dedicated to iron ore mining and production of something called Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), which can also be used in EAFs. The minimal waste of resources and maximized production is key to Ternium beating much of the steel industry.\n\nEvery single item you use from lambos, appliances, home goods, and even electronics need this steel.We can see the effects of inflation and these rising prices as used cars are somehow appreciating in value and construction costs are going vertical.\n\n# Steel Goes BRRRRR:\n\nAs you know, the steel industry is booming right now. HRC futures prices (Hot Rolled Coils) are through the roof, with nearly every month through 2022 above $1000, a **50% increase** within the past 6 months. Because of both Buyden\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s infrastructure talks and sustained global demand as China plays games with exports and imports, the steel industry **IS THE BEST SECTOR** from an inflationary and money making machine standpoint. Inflation is **not** transitory as JPOW keeps lying to us, but will have long term consequences as the money printer continues to go brrr too.\n\nTX exports across the globe and operates specifically in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Southern U.S.\n\n**For the degenerates who actually use their brain cells, $TX is currently immune to tariffs.** The Section 232 tariffs the U.S. placed on steel do not apply to the rest of North America aka Mexico and Canada. This means that all the steel produced there can be sold at full premium.\n\nIf $TX is smart and follows through with opening an actual plant in the U.S. to pair with its U.S. operations, this would be in their best interest. As China continues to export less steel (with a potential export tax) and massive infrastructure plans about to be signed in place, $TX has a golden opportunity to produce massive steel dildos of profits.\n\n# Financials:\n\n**$TX was basically immune to coronavirus. You could give this bitch the Indian triple variant and it would still pump out profits like there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s no tomorrow.**\n\nArgentina and Brazil continued to have strong construction and home demands, and as a result, in Q1 of 2021, Ternium had an **EPS of $3.07, a 45% increase from the previous quarter, beating estimates by 36%.** Just like every other steel company, TX is taking the \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3fuck you, pay me\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 approach. As steel prices continue to rise, so does TX\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s offering of flat steel. It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s like an infinite tendie machine.\n\n\\##**Analyst ANALysis:**\n\n*\u00d4\u00c7\u00a3$TX (Ternium S.A.) has a Q2 2021 EPS estimate of $3.42 (only a slight increase over their Q1 $3.07 EPS number). This appears absurdly low which will mean another high percentage beat by $TX as analysts are surprised once again.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8*  \\- u/BlueWolf1983\n\nUsing some of his mathemagical skills, he determined that half of their Q2 sales should be based on previous Q1 prices. That appears to be somewhere in the $1200s. Assuming a Q1 2021 price of $1210 and an average Q2 2021 spot price of $1490, this would be a price of **$1,350 per ton**.\n\nAgain, based on these prices, he then calculated the following:\n\n*\u00d4\u00c7\u00a3In the following chart, I've further added their cost per ton by taking the cost of their steel sales in Q1 of 2020 and dividing it by their total steel shipments. As they mentioned input costs would marginally increase, I've given that roughly a flat 5% 10% input cost increase. As on their Q2 call they mentioned input price increases lag due to existing inventory + reserves and as they mine their own ore, that should be sufficient.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|Shipments (in thousands of tons )|Q2 2021 Estimated Ton Price|Q2 2021 Cost Per Ton Estimate|Profit Per Ton|Total Profit (in Millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mexico|1699|$1,350|$770|$580|$985.42|\n|Southern Region|680.8|$1,210|$770|$440|$299.56|\n|Other Markets|687.7|$1,100|$770|$330|$226.94|\n\n*It appears they sell electricity in Mexico and Brazil as well. This is way too hard to try to figure out a Q2 estimate for. As this seems to range between 44M and 59M in profits for them, we will just add 50M to get a new total profit of:* ***$1,566.92M.***\n\nDoing more math that went slightly over my head, the final EPS calculated should be: $**4.48.**\n\n**This is all based on data approximately 1 month old, which means the EPS would likely be higher.** **From a conservative standpoint, this is another 35% beat of the previous quarter\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s EPS.**\n\n# Mega Shart Interest Stats:\n\n**Currently, the shart interest on TX is ranging around 15%.** In the past month alone, the number of shares sharted increased by about 10%.\n\n[Shart Volume Graph](https://preview.redd.it/72urus3obk471.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba20440bab38aff74777d66c2f4274ee8e572319)\n\n# Here\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s where things get interesting with the price action:\n\nHOW is it that a company that is making **TRIPLE PROFITS** over the past 3 months due to increasing HRC prices, STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN MARCH. When earnings come out, $TX will blow through the roof and rest at its fair price of $55. But even now, it should be worth **ATLEAST** $42 at a minimum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctkmseesbk471.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=674ff4dd914b7bbbbc46043e02f0b73381833881\n\n# AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS TO BUY:\n\n[Citadel sCheMiNg](https://preview.redd.it/44h0yditbk471.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5ae6d643514394671fb62a8bd2cb70f78b612)\n\n**Citadel has been placing short positions on $TX since May,** which is the exact same time its price began to be suppressed. This isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t some conspiracy or anything, just basing it on facts.\n\n# \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557 Case:\n\nThe one thing I can see affecting profits is if cartels manage to take over the national government and seize control of the manufacturing industry. During the elections this past week, which also contributed to Mexican company stocks taking a dive, a lot of cartels were on assassination sprees.The political turmoil in Mexico could causes instability in the supply chain in the short-term. I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t see this as a problem considering everyone needs steel and that cartels can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t drive the price downv just through political shenanigans.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n# Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently, has medium shart interest, a smaller market cap, AND it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago (due to funds like Citadel) despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3fuck you, pay me\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company.\n\nMy Positions:\n\n**10 contracts of 8/20 50C**\n\nI will be averaging in with about 50 more contracts of the September 45Cs too.\n\nThanks to u/JayArlington and u/Bluewolf1983 for data and inferences made throughout this post.\n\nThanks to u/Dan_inKuwait for helping get this approved.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**If you like money,  buy into steel or $TX.

The last time I felt so strongly about a stock was 2010 when TSLA became public.  I told my wife that Tesla would be worth 10 times the IPO value in 10 years if they didn't go bankrupt, and I figured there was about a 10% chance they'd go bankrupt in the first couple years.  I bought Tesla around $19, and sold a year and a half later for about $24 to pay off my house.  There wasn't a lot of movement, but it was a gain, and I wanted to do the responsible thing creating a life where I was debt free.  I planned to replenish the position over the next 6 months.  Unfortunately my timing couldn't be worse.  A month after I sold, the stock skyrocketed to $85.  Later, it then rose to $135 a month or two later.  It was no longer the deal it has once been, and I never felt that it was worth chasing.  Biggest mistake of my investing career.  I point this out because you just never know when things will explode, but if you know the company well enough you can determine that it's an inevitability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) used to be known as Quicken Loans, which was established in 1985.  When the company decided to go digital, they changed their name to Rocket Companies.  Rocket Companies has only been around since 2016.  Quicken Loans grew at a 25% compound annualized growth rate (CAGR), and before the company went public, Rocket Companies had a 16% CAGR between 2016 and 2020.  With a 16% CAGR, the company doubles in size every 5 years just for reference.  Below is the S-1 document showing their CAGR before they became public in 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince Becoming public, RKT has had some impressive growth indeed.   Income grew 526%, and revenue grew 187%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2k8f3xhrik471.png?width=2248&format=png&auto=webp&s=62d09fbb033af6fde28719273cc9ea2da7580c35\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntvln76sik471.png?width=2252&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c99d8deea18a00861a434042ec3f0bb06e09188\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reporting the 2020 year results, the stock skyrocketed of course.  This only lasted a few days before it came back down settling right back to where the stock came from.  The stock was roughly $20 or so before the results, and after it rose somewhere near $45 from a pump and dump situation.  The price then fell for about 2-3 straight months back down to where it came from.  The primary reason for the price dropping from something that was closer to a realistic price target back down to the low 20s was the belief that interest rates were going to rise in 2021-2023 due to inflation.  That was going to kill home buying, and this was \"as good as it gets\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE WAR WITH UWMC:**\n\nTo add to the industry problems, UWMC started a war with RKT.  This war was started because RKT was taking market share in every direction.  UWMC is a great company, but it's a distant second in overall lending origination as you can see in this list below of the top lending companies for 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iukjdhnvik471.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=de37da1ec33a9f1f36d59507836c47e99139ab87\n\nBy the end of 2020, Rocket Companies had 8.9% of the entire housing loan origination market in the US.  They continued to grow that market share in the latest reported quarter to somewhere in the mid 9% range.   In the beginning of March, UWMC issued an ultimatum that all realtors who use UWMC are not allowed to use RKT anymore.  That means one month (March) in Q1 would be affected by this new ultimatum.  Both UWMC and RKT declared victory within the first week of March.  We would have to wait for Q1 earning to come out to see who was really winning the war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1 earnings came out, and here are the results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3bsmsvzik471.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53584a6f687dc76ef89ccc1d9263f0657c9ba84\n\nFor a direct comparison, here is Q4-2021 which was not affected by the ultimatum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzxh7mjjrl471.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ea5ea1ef7adf4988ac1bee1527db90d4526f8c7\n\nThe loan volume for RKT increased nearly $3B from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021.  Below is a chart showing you the loan volume for UWMC in that same time period.  As you can see, the loan volume DECREASED by over $5.6B.  A winner has been declared, and it means that RKT is taking market share even quicker due to the ultimatum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8c3rm1rlrl471.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5d0f2d391afd2f9ffc0d61a5da03538c1aca379\n\nNow, this entire war was started to try to stop RKT from taking market share from UWMC.  All UWMC had to do was read a little bit of recent history, and know that competitors tried to do the same thing when Amazon was starting out.  Many vendors refused to use Amazon because they took a fee, and felt they could make more money per sale if they were independent.  Unfortunately those vendors eventually learned that volume can make profits go up faster than premiums with less sales.  Amazon of course won that war, and RKT will do the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe primary focus for Rocket Companies is very clear when it comes to growth--gain market share.  They are not the least bit worried about profits because their Direct to Consumer lending is the largest in the US by a long shot.  This plays a key roll in the war with UWMC.  UWMC dropped their interest rates (effectively buying down the interest rate for the customer) to try to keep agents with them when they issued the ultimatum.  Of course, RKT followed suit to match them, and the war is causing the entire industry to see their margins tighten.    Margins for wholesale are roughly 2% for both RKT and UWMC, after dropping the interest rates 50bps.  Direct to Consumer margins are over 5%.   Well, UWMC doesn't do direct to consumer lending, so they are fighting a battle they can't win.  They can continue to buy down interest rates until they go negative and have no profits if they wanted to.  Rocket Companies will continue to always be profitable because a larger part of their business is Direct to Consumer with higher margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3klqg3xajk471.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=79191aae6c0fd945540479c518d2dd173bcf9fad\n\nIn light of this war, Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner have come forward stating their new goal is to be the largest wholesale lender by 2023 (2 years).  They are already the largest overall lender, and the largest direct to consumer lender.  They are winning the market share battle, and numbers don't lie.  It comes at a cost of lower margins which reduce profit.  Keep in mind that Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years.  The fact that RKT is hugely profitable is amazing as they continue to acquire market share in the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MORE THAN JUST MORTGAGES:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket Companies is a FinTech play.  RKT has been testing their technologies in other businesses, and have determined that many of them translate to other loan industries.  The one with the largest prospects is automobiles.  Rocket Auto has been testing their products for the past year or so, and are happy with the ability for the technologies to transition into the auto retail marketplace.  Rocket Auto recently formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi, a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry with a network of more than 2,000 dealership partners.  This is not live yet to my knowledge, but during the first quarter, they sold over $360M in volume, and are on track to do over $1B this year.  Rocket owns their own titling company called Amrock.  They make up the bulk of the \"Other income\" line in their quarterly/yearly reports.  At this point, the auto sales only generated $13M in profit for Q1 2021.  There is no website launched for Rocket Auto yet, and it'll take awhile to integrate the technologies in with AutoFi, but this is a huge market which will grow at an exponential rate in the next couple years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g42p4awgjk471.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee95ca12421e164975651eed63e82e7f7b3d4c0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6u5n7wqkjk471.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=e138940c684d71aa219005ba55336ca51d2d6b4c\n\nAlso, Rocket Mortgage is going international.  They are beginning their expansion in Canada, so this is a very big market which will show lots of growth for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INFLATION FEARS:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas inflation increased?  Absolutely.  But it has had very little effect on interest rates.  Interest rates increased at the beginning of the year and were expected to increase for the next 2 years at a very fast rate.  The fact is that analysts guessed wrong.  Fed Chairman has stuck to his word and has not increased rates, and doesn't expect to until after 2023.  Interest rates did increase very dramatically at the start of the year, and then it stopped increasing at the end of March.  In fact, interest rates have decreased nearly 0.3% in the past 3 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41c46f2ojk471.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a7b2dd29fcc14e632ba789d1348be642a25be3\n\nThis is going to cause refinances to pick up again slightly, and investors know it.  RKT has been a notoriously shorted stock since it IPOed because hedge funds believed that it was as good as it gets in the middle of 2020 when they IPOed.  For 2 quarters in a row, RKT proved every naysayer wrong growing more than anyone expected, and becoming more profitable than anyone expected.  EBITDA in 2020 was roughly $11B, and the company's market cap sits around $41bln currently.  They are making more money than they can possibly use, so they issued a special dividend last year of $1.11 which was about 5% of the value of the stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow, you can see the short interest dropped to roughly 8% in March when they reported blow out earnings.  It then increased in May, to roughly 17% after earnings showed the gain on sales decreased do to the war with UWMC dropping interest rates half a percent, and slightly less refinancing occurring due to interest rates rising at the beginning of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznsz1brjk471.png?width=2154&format=png&auto=webp&s=679e86c24f24c924e9eac3ea68fc30a5b8b5cde7\n\nAs interest rates have started dropping again, you can see the shorts are leaving the stock.  Roughly 7.5 million shares have come back available in the past two weeks, and interest to borrow has dropped due to lack of demand to short the stock.  Interest rates dropping will have all lending companies out performing expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzj988ptjk471.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13f6ef5e156d0a2e2e6286a09468f2ec0aca563\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, it doesn't matter if the housing market does incredibly well over the next 5 years or not.  RKT has made it clear that their goal is to have 25% market share of the mortgage industry by 2030, which is 3 times their market share compared to last year.   They will gain market share even faster in years the housing market is bad, and their retention for customers can't be matched.  The industry average return customer is 20%, and RKTs return rate is over 90%.  Their process is simple, digital, can all be done through an app or their website, and has made the lending process infinitely easier than traditional loans.  They make billions of dollars a years, have $1B set aside for share buybacks if they decide that's in the shareholders interest, and has a better balance sheet than anyone else in the business.  You pay a slightly higher multiple than you would if you purchased another company like UWMC, but their growth is nearly double UWMC, and they are taking market share away from UWMC, so it's worth far more than any other lending company.  In general, all lending companies are undervalued currently, RKT just happens to be the next \"Amazon\" of lending, and it's hard to put a price on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe the company is worth around $40 a share currently which is about 100% above where it is trading now.  By 2030, the company should be worth worth around $200B-300B which is roughly  5-7 times current evaluation.  It's not the 10 times in 10 years that I felt Tesla was worth in 2010, but there is zero chance RKT goes bankrupt, and there was always a chance Tesla could in the first few years.  Read Elon Musk's biography and you'll see just how close he was to bankruptcy twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't tell you when the stock will go up.  The stock price isn't reflective of the company currently.  Sometimes they can stay disconnected for awhile.  But I learned my lesson when I sold TSLA to pay off my house.  You never know when a stock is going to explode, you just know that it's an inevitability.  While everyone else is running for the next pump and dump on Reddit to hopefully gain 100% in a week (I admit I do this as well although I never put too much in), I'd rather invest with the majority of my money.  I know that at some point I'll see a huge return in the next few years.  Typically in the stock market, it doubles your money every 7 years if you have your money tracking the S&P500.  I've found a company that will give me 5-7 times that amount in near the same time frame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for all the typos, this got so long, and it's so late now that I'm not going to go back and proof read.", "votes": 382, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9997, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 05:03:56", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 12:05:49", "reddit_post_id": "nx7vfo"}, "1002": {"post_id": 15296, "author_id": 618734, "post_title": "What's Happening right now.", "self_text": "", "votes": 724, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 12:43:32", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 12:05:56", "reddit_post_id": "nxf3jy"}, "1003": {"post_id": 15297, "author_id": 556586, "post_title": "$BBagholder, reporting for duty!

Them being GMC, AMC, and CLOV.  The goal has always remained the same - getting a glorious ride down to Tendietown. The question becomes: what vehicle will take you there?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdedudrktm471.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=0133522e11a119a16c9543fb4d83ee6a095b7fcb\n\nTwo of the stonks mentioned above are quite familiar, if not exhausted on WSB. Yes, yes, we all love GME & AMC but the newcomer of the group is the most tantalizing at this time. That's Mr. Clover Health. Currently, CLOV has the highest percentage of free float on loan (52%) of all three of Ihor's top picks It is the most shorted large cap stock on the market. It also has the lowest share price due to not squeezing like we've seen with GME and AMC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cntopc1ntm471.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28fb7632879169a52f0dbbbe85c60f8ec8f0ce1\n\nNow that my $50 per month (fuck you Ortex) has deduced that CLOV it's ripe for the picking, let's discuss why this big green banana hammock is much different than our previously mentioned WSB conquests. I'll roll through a few potential catalyst for Clover that could send the stock skyward resulting in an epic \"Get Shorty\" moment.\n\n1. For one, GME and AMC were both burning through cash and on the rainbow road to gay bear bankruptcy when the suits decided to short them into oblivion. Clover Health is a bit of a different story. They had sales of $670M in 2020 and are guiding for $800-900M in 2021. They are sitting on close to $1B in cash. The primary difference is that they are a technology/growth company rather than a legacy company needing to restructure and take on debt to stay alive. That means no dilution. A rare case for such a heavily shorted stock.\n2. **Russell 3000** At the close of June 25th Clover Health will be added to the Russell 3000. This means every ETF that tracks the fund will have to add shares of CLOV to their portfolio. This is enough of a catalyst to move any stonk. But it could create back breaking movement for the bears. [June Russell 3000 Additions](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf)\n3. **Markets** CLOV operates in very few states right now. They have ridiculously small percentage of the Medicare spending pool which was estimated over $800B in 2020. They are scaling rapidly and onboarding in new states every quarter. They also inked a deal with America's largest employer - Wal Mart. [Bloomberg - WalMart Partners With Medicare Startup Clover](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/walmart-s-next-health-foray-is-medicare-plan-with-startup-clover)\n4. CLOV wants to implement machine learning to reduce Medicare costs per patient. Many people don't know this but it was backed by the best machine learning company in the world, Google. [Alphabet Backed Medicare Startup Clover Health Raises $500M](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/). They do this using the Clover assistant, which has a growing penetration rate among physicians aims to save the government lots of doll hairs. This will open more doors for CLOV.\n5. **Medicare Expansion**  Sleepy Joe Biden and would love to lower the Medicare age to 60. Why? I don't fucking know. Because more free healthcare is cool now I guess. [JoeBiden.com Health Insurance Plan](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) This kind of policy would increase the total addressable market share immediately for a company like CLOV.\n6. **Management Team/Stock Lockup:** The CEO, executives and investors have most of their interest in the company tied to the stock. The CEO does not receive a salary and insiders cannot sell until CLOV reaches an average share price of $30 for a 90 day period. We're not going to have a mass insider selloff ala' Palantir. **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board was a former CFO of Livongo/Teledoc while Chelsea Clinton is also a board member.** If we know anything about the Clinton's, it's that they get their money and have plenty of government influence.\n\nSo in a nutshell, you've got too many positive catalysts for all the suits on Wall Street to be betting against this future disruptor. Way too many, in my smooth brained opinion. They got caught with their pants down this week but the short position remains higher than ever. I think it's an undervalued stock with tremendous growth potential.\n\nIt's late now and I ate too many crayons today so I'm going to bed. I' am not a financial advisor but I do own own 14,000 shares of CLOV. Other more intelligible DD's can be found here, here, and here:\n\n* [12\" DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/n04d77/lets_get_clov_right/)\n* [11\" DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/n388i9/clov_dd/)\n* [Medium DD](https://livinittt.medium.com/retail-investors-are-changing-markets-forever-ed4077047d52)\n* [Slideshow with Pretty Photos](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213)\n\nTL:DR CLOV is unequivocally the best in breed short candidate on the market today as it has a number of growth catalysts ahead. Unlike other options, it does not need more cash or a business restructuring to be successful. This thing is a kettle pot ready to explode. Consider boarding this train before it leaves the station.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJosephWarrenBuffetDirt", "votes": 234, "post_title_sentiment": 0.6369, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9982, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 12:45:46", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 12:06:42", "reddit_post_id": "nxf56t"}, "1016": {"post_id": 15310, "author_id": 612884, "post_title": "Finally we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re seeing some respect being put onto NIO.

I'd rather yolo into a company, Cassava Sciences (SAVA), with consistent, promising results and a $2.6B market cap that will own the AD market.*\n\n# A Troubling Decision\n\nOn June 7, the FDA approved Biogen's Aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) sparking front-page worthy controversy. Facing intense pressure to approve a drug for a disease with no cure and no new treatments since 2003, the FDA chose to approve Aducanumab in the face of overwhelming opposition from the medical community ([\\[1\\]](https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/30/if-the-fda-approves-biogens-alzheimers-treatment-i-wont-prescribe-it/), [\\[2\\]](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12213)). Prior to this approval, the FDA head of neurology Billy Dunn faced intense scrutiny for giving Biogen unprecedented leniency in the phase 3 trial review ([\\[3\\]](https://www.citizen.org/news/hhs-inspector-general-must-investigate-fdas-inappropriate-collaboration-with-biogen-on-alzheimers-disease-drug-public-citizen-demands/)). Long story short: the two phase 3 trials Biogen conducted were deemed inconclusive regarding the efficacy of Aducanumab's primary endpoint: **cognition**. 23% of patients dropped out of both trials due to side effects of the drug: most notably brain swelling and in some cases, brain bleeds ([\\[4\\]](https://investors.biogen.com/static-files/8e58afa4-ba37-4250-9a78-2ecfb63b1dcb)). Both trials were stopped at the halfway point after preliminary analysis found that they were unlikely to show efficacy. Instead of rejecting the drug, the FDA stepped in with Biogen to salvage the trials.\n\nAs more details about Aducanumab came out following approval, the noise surrounding this decision only grew. News of the $56000 a year price tag on Aducanumab ([\\[5\\]](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/557206-biogen-ceo-says-56k-a-year-for-new-alzheimers-drug-is-a-fair-price)) hit the Reddit front page and if you'd take a gander at any of the comment sections discussing Aducanumab, you'll see a range of responses, including this one from r/medicine:\n\n>FDA granted approval to aducanumab on the basis of the reduction of beta amyloid \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 NOT for the slowing of cognitive decline in patients. This is frankly a troubling shift away from clinical efficacy and towards biomarker endpoints (which we don't even know if the beta amyloid hypothesis is correct). Everyone is now going to be burdened with the cost (except Biogen and Biogen investors) to test whether or not the amyloid hypothesis is correct.\n\nand this one from r/nottheonion:\n\n>The real scam is that the drug hasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t even been proven to be very effective, if at all.\n\nThe June 7th decision was made without a second vote from the FDA panel of scientists which initially voted 10 out of 11 against approval ([\\[6\\]](https://apnews.com/article/dementia-alzheimers-disease-8ce05b6c22ca4e649d299bb3abafe43a)), with the 11th medical scientist recusing himself from the vote due to conflict of interest, and was expected to vote against approval again.\n\nFollowing the June 7 decision, ~~two~~ three out of the 11 panelists resigned from their position ([\\[7\\]](https://kelo.com/2021/06/09/two-members-of-u-s-fda-advisory-panel-resign-over-alzheimers-drug-approval/), [\\[11\\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/third-member-of-prestigious-fda-panel-resigns-over-approval-of-biogens-alzheimers-drug.html)), including the Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman who had initially recused himself because he consulted for Biogen.\n\n**stink to high heaven**\n\n1. To have a very strong, unpleasant odor.\n   1. *Can* *you* *take* *this* *trash* *out?* *It* *stinks* *to* *high* *heaven.*\n2. To be or seem extremely disreputable, suspicious, or corrupt.\n   1. *This* *decision by the FDA on Aducanumab stinks* *to* *high* *heaven,* *if* *you* *ask* *me.*\n\n# So What's Next?\n\nOne investor on r/stocks suggests:\n\n>Short it. Amyloid-based treatments, even when effective at removing plaques, have consistently failed to stall disease progression.\n\nUnfortunately, turning gay bear isn't the best way to approach such a colossal fuck-up. Who knows how long it will take for Aducanumab to finally get pulled. Spreading awareness about the serious risks and extremely dubious science involved in the approval is the best way to counteract the harm this decision may bring.\n\nBut this is WallStreetBets, so I'm giving you another option.\n\n**Cassava Sciences (SAVA)** has a first in class drug, **Simufilam**, that works by stabilizing a critical protein filamin A in the brain ([\\[8\\]](https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/e2630158-8c5d-40f5-8737-c034815b3984)). Unlike Aducanumab and countless failed drugs before it, Simufilam does not seek to clear amyloid out of the brain. SAVA completed phase 2 trials showing no serious side effects and is moving on to phase 3 trials. On February\u252c\u00e12, 2021, Cassava Sciences announced positive results of a first interim analysis that summarizes clinical data on the first 50 subjects to complete 6 months of open-label treatment. Patients\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 cognition scores **improved** from baseline following 6 months of Simufilam treatment, with no safety issues. Six months of Simufilam treatment improved cognition scores by 1.6 points on ADAS-Cog11, a 10% mean improvement from baseline to month 6.\n\nIn September 2020, SAVA shot up on positive phase 2b results. In February 2021, SAVA hit all time highs of $117.54 after releasing interim analysis of open label (no control) results. In an interview with Being Patient Alzheimer's, ([\\[9\\]](https://fb.watch/61oKeaYp-m/)) the CEO Remi Barbier responded to a question: \"In particular, what did the data say that made you excited?\"\n\n>It's not any one specific data. That's the difference with our approach. It's the consistency of data from the basic research to the animal data, to the CSF biomarkers, to the early cognition, to the open label study. There's a consistent theme that, in my opinion, the world of Alzheimer's Disease R&D has never seen before.\n\nThe next milestone is nine month open label results. No prior AD drug has shown improvement at nine months.\n\n# Just How Far is it to the Moon?\n\nOn the day of the decision BIIB stock was halted for the greater portion of the trading day and when trading finally resumed, BIIB stock soared 63% from $286 to $468.55 immediately after the decision (closing the day at $395.85 a share). With 150M shares, this represented a market capitalization increase of $27B from $43B to $70.5B. The market thinks an Alzheimer's drug is worth $27B in market cap.\n\nSAVA right now is currently trading at a market capitalization of about $2.66B. Assuming a $27B valuation, **SAVA represents a true 10x opportunity** from the current market price of $66.38 to my price target: **$663.80**. Regarding timeline, SAVA is about start its phase 3 trials (H2 2021) and will release 9 month Open Label results on July 26th at the 2021 Alzheimer's Association International Conference.

Insider buying shows extreme confidence in the stock and the CEO has diamond hands.\n\n>Despite a stock rally that makes his 5% stake -- including options -- worth more than $100 million, Barbier says he\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s not selling. \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3I know the science, I know the data, I know the disease and this stuff looks promising and I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m putting my money where my mouth is.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8\n\n2) Despite the fact that SAVA receives basically no attention on this forum, Bloomberg is all too happy to ascribe it meme status.

Doesn't always work on both sides of the trade just like picking up or down daily.\n\nFYI im not a pro, not advice, I like charts.\n\nStart with weekly....stock has had selling pressure from week 2 and has only had one real break up but still overall had selling weight on it based on the weekly (IPO charts are hard since they don't have a tail to follow).\n\nFirst attempt out of the gate was that breakout over 40 and failed. can't tell you why. I can say that it seems to have become selling pressure from everyone that got in up top cashed out below or made off great with short positions.......so what. Stock was driven from 40+ to around 17 or so......thats a sizable move on both sides to make money.\n\nThere is hope. a divergence is forming on the Macd weekly showing buyers in that drop coming in and the rounding bottom of the lower indicator shows buying pressure coming in. Indicators are lagging.....so the action ahead of it has accord. Its a general guide of when you have possibly gone too far or are about to. Anyways,\n\nThe 0 level on MacD is a common form of resistance and support when it matches with the trading chart....so the MACD being below 0 now means we have weekly selling pressure but tide is turning on smaller time frames (that is why larger is curling, daily is).\n\nSo.....our GOAL is that the MACD will curl up and proceed to push back into POSITIVE LAND. enough said.\n\nDAILY......\n\nNice looking inverse hand and shoulders from the gap after earnings. MACD floated positive and you can see the result......dips get bought up. The stock feels easy going right? Yes it consolidates, but in a gentle, bullish manner. For all you stair case ladder attack morons......this would be what shorts call their inverse ladder attack.\n\nalso side note, that shit doesn't exist. its just buyers and sellers and some have more money so they can manipulate price with bids and flash asks to get prices to move and retail to sell......part of the game. there is a reason some only look at closing price......\n\nANYWAYS.....DAILY CHART.....is finally starting a nice return off negative land. The shorter timeframes have made it up into positive space but the longer timeframe needs to catch up. Its like the difference of a stock banging the first time in a week or a stock banging after it got some action earlier in the morning also and can hold it's composure for longer under thrusts.....yes we talking about stocks.\n\nYou will notice that the stock jumped the gun up to the gap fill but the indicators hadn't caught up yet meaning that simply a retrace is allowed to reset and profit taking and so on and so forth in due time.\n\n2 days of that form the handle we would hope, 1 more could work in.\n\nWith that said.....go look at the daily and I bet it landed on or closed at a 5 day moving average probably.....just saying math works.\n\nSo...we sit on a retrace level with sentiment seeming to be shifting.....$30 is what a daily head and shoulders would target.\n\ndo you also see the line that says $31.24?  THAT IS A START\n\nPrime fib level to nail and have some consolidation......\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3k2z4kktj471.png?width=2004&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4fa9cae045cffec355579a0b2c909b9cc275435\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poh5c5kktj471.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=f67e6fb64014c696a76d3a573ca5cd65c2fba8b8", "votes": 77, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9878, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 02:35:28", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 12:07:22", "reddit_post_id": "nx592e"}, "1027": {"post_id": 15321, "author_id": 597018, "post_title": "Millionaire in the making \u00ad\u0192\u00e6\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ff\u00a3\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00f4\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00f4\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00c7", "self_text": "", "votes": 77, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 09:29:58", "date_pulled": "2021-06-11 12:07:28", "reddit_post_id": "nxbuhm"}, "1028": {"post_id": 15322, "author_id": 289584, "post_title": "Relative Rotation Graph (RRGs) Discussion: 6/11/2021", "self_text": "  Greetings Gents,\n\nFirst off, this is not professional financial advice\u00d4\u00c7\u00aainvest at your own peril. \n\nIt\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s been a crazy week for meme stocks.

You've probably seen some DD floating around, and I'm sure that by know you know the basics about CLNE. Here's a quick summary:\n\n* They make RNG (net carbon NEGATIVE fuel)\n* They have an effective \\*\\*monopoly\\*\\* on RNG distribution. Monopolies are good. We like Monopolies.\n* RNG is the only viable, green energy source for long-haul trucking\n* Favorable regulatory environment (federal and state) is accelerating the move to RNG\n\n# Market Size\n\nHow big could this RNG market be? Well, in 2019, the U.S. consumed 47.2 BILLION gallons of diesel. That's a lot of greenhouse gases heating up the atmosphere, if you're into that sortof thing. Now, RNG is not going to replace diesel overnight, because the infra to convert animal waste to RNG has to be built out. But, it could reasonably be a 5-7 billion gallon market in 10 years, which would position CLNE to be a MAJOR player.\n\nOk, so that sounds promising. But, it's \\*\\*even better\\*\\* than is appears at first glance.  I'm not going to rehash other DD that you've probably seen by now on the above topics - if you don't understand the bullet pts above, read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/) or [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqyndj/clne_imagine_flinging_cow_manure_at_the_hedgies/).\n\n# Cow Farts\n\nSelling 5-7 billion gallons a year of carbon NEGATIVE fuel. That's a shitload of money. And it would be great for the environment. Sound like \\*bullshit\\*? Yes, indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cow farts on the right](https://preview.redd.it/77h45estwm471.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=4779b1a581eba4f6ecc3758d0297bf86aa06f237)\n\nAs you can see, RNG is the ONLY carbon negative fuel source, according to the California Air Resources Board. Electric is actually way worse than it looks on that chart too.\n\n# Electric is a joke\n\nElon has done an incredible job marketing EVs and the concept of electric cars. He might be the best fucking salesman in human history. And Wall Street is convinced EVs are the future of all transportation. And clearly it is going to be the future for personal transportation, last mile deliveries, public transit, etc, because that's where all the investment is going.\n\nHe's convinced people to feel morally superior for buying electric, and moral superiority is a hell of a product. But when you stop to think about it for even a second, EVs have a lot of problems. For one, you charge the damn thing using the existing electricity grid, the baseload power for which comes from coal and CNG power plants. So, everyone switching to EVs is just increasing demand for burning GHGs. Second, charging a battery has some insane limitations - it takes a long time, even for a relatively small consumer car battery. Third, batteries are expensive af.\n\nAnyway, EVs just shift the pollution from your car's exhaust to the coal-fired power plant down the road. You're not really solving the problem.\n\nAlso, EV is impractical and expensive for long-haul trucking (which runs on diesel), and as we've seen above, that's a **GIGANTIC** market. A truck isn't going to lug 10 tons of batteries that take 8 hours to charge every 300 miles. That would be really retarded.\n\n# Valuation\n\nCLNE is cheap af compared to other growth stocks. And Wall Street has taken notice. The average analyst PT is $19.60 and the highest is $27. And that is based on fundamentals, before us apes got involved. It's trading at \\~$11\n\nValue and MEME potential? You got it. This is a lot more than just hot air.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nTLDR: Buy shares.

Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue.

This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n\n\n\n**TL:DR** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money...

WISH sales/revenue are increasing significantly.\n2. WISH has had a lot of complaints about delivery delays, poor quality of products they sell, however, they have been improving their service for the past year, so many sellers and buyers started giving more positive reviews.\n3. WISH has started delivery through small business locations, which significantly improve the delivery time and convenience as well as provides marketing advantages. The only fact that the WISH logo is in every single corner in the city makes this brand very recognizable. Together with quality improvement, brand loyalty will only increase and sales will follow.\n4. WISH has been spending lots of cash on marketing which is starting to pay off. I expect Q2 earnings to confirm my expectations.\n5. The wall street analytics' average price target is 91% from today's levels.\n6. Technical analysis shows 8 bullish signs and 2 bearish.\n\nSo conclusion: Improving business, with great management, increasing revenue, great marketing strategies, increase in brand recognition, improvement in products' quality and being one of the WSB favorite stock makes me confident in my investment.\n\nDisclosure: I am not a fin. advisor.

Stronger than any Columbian BAM BAM on the market.\n\nNow that I plugged my sponsor I can get into the post. I'm really fucking sick and tired of listening to CNBC and the same response comes out \"These Wall Street Bets kids don't understand fundamentals\" Well motherfucker I'm gonna give you it. Throughout this post, I will be teaching metrics and explaining them, so before I am ripped a new asshole by the people who already know, **this post is for Newbies, and experts** so feel free to skip the bullshit comments like \"*I aLrEaDy KnOw WhAt ThE dEfEnItIoN oF vAlUaTiOn Is\".* Secondly, this shit takes wayyyyyyy too long for this to be buried into the feed of horrible DD, Literally do your part and upvote, so we can all be well informed. Trust me this shit is even boring to someone taking PED's but we deserve to be well informed.\n\n# Relative Valuation for ContextLogic Inc. performed by Baconnator69420.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSo for those who are new to valuation, I will give my overall thesis as to why I am so bullish on the position ContextLogic. First off let's define what relative valuation is so that we can get a better understanding of why these metrics are useful.\n\n**Relative Valuation**\\- also called valuation using multiples is the notion of comparing the price of an asset to the market value of similar assets. In the field of securities investment, the idea has led to important practical tools, which could presumably spot pricing anomalies.\n\n*(for the dumbasses, comparing numbers to other companies numbers)*\n\n[**The 4 Important metrics when valuing a business is**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/elements-stock-value.asp)\n\n* Price to Book Value or (P/B)\n* Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)\n* Price to Earnings Growth (PEG)\n* Dividend Yield \\*Note this stock does not currently pay a dividend\\*\n\nFurther Fundamentals will be considered as we take apart the most recent filing for ContextLogic Inc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Body** \n\nThe first metric we will be looking at is the price to book value of the company of ContextLogic. Price to Book essentially calculates the market value of the company and the intrinsic value of its actual holdings. Further explanation is what is the company actually worth without participating in the market. It is the calculation of all the assets the company currently holds. Most of this information will be pulled and calculated from the website [MacroAxis](https://www.macroaxis.com/stock/WISH/Contextlogic-Inc-Cl) so feel free to access the information Via the hyper-link.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price to Book vs Current Valuation ](https://preview.redd.it/xnypsj1bln471.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=48266c4526b6a9566f1f004253a199360eaf93f5)\n\nThis alone proves the overall undervaluation of the company ContextLogic. Looking on the X-axis we can see that in the market we have a similar Current Valuation to competitors, but are not trading at as high of a multiple as a company such as MELI, ZLNDY, or EBAY. These are all E-Commerce companies, CVNA will not be considered with Chip shortage because that is the sole reason it is trading at such a premium because they are in used cars. So looking similarly we can conclude that growth is to be expected as a company like ZLNDY trades at 13.68 P/B with a current valuation of 24.9B. Whereas $WISH has a 5.51 P/B. This allows us to conclude this could very well be a 50$ PT in the coming future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short Ratio to Total Debt ](https://preview.redd.it/4m4f3o8gpn471.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=f971126f4839485580c02148c8277a6af83b0c98)\n\nThis analysis shows the total debt on the X-axis and the Short Ratio on Y-axis. Again CVNA will not be included. Similarly, we can point to the thesis that this company maintains low amounts of debt in fact the least amount of debt compared to other companies operating in E-commerce. The current short ratio is arguably pointing to the conclusion that this stock is heavily being targeted by shorts with not a lot of fundamentals to back it other than \"Wish sells shitty products\". That is a harmful thesis as we have a market expectation of high inflation. With high inflation, people will have less money which further affirms that customers will transition into secondary goods, AKA shitty $WISH products. This is not a bad thing. Another correlation to this is during times of economic downturn we see many consumers shopping at discount stores such as Dollar General or Dollar Tree. Overall the market is not very forward-thinking if we consider those facts alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BF EV\\/Rev](https://preview.redd.it/8ouz8bsjtn471.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=9affd94a41c074ade14d4fc15f7b1d1d54587bad)\n\nThe last part of this valuation will be my Price targets and analysis of the reasoning.\n\nThis is a [Bloomberg Quote Snapshot](https://bba.bloomberg.net/Content/Html5/Citrix/src/SessionWindow.html?launchid=1623427103961) at 12:05 EST June 11th, 2021\n\nBF EV/Rev quotes $WISH at a 1.3x multiple. We can consider based on previous research that this company maintains low debt, but trades at a low premium relative to earnings in this market. Competitor EV/Rev averages 6.2x multiple considering this metric we can conclude by doing some simple math 6.2x/1.3x = 4.7692307692x is the room for wish to grow. An almost 5 BAGGER HAHAH. Multiplying this number by our current stock price of $10.13 x 4.7692307692 = $48.31 which would give us our overall price target based on competitor performance. Safe to say this is very undervalued.

The easiest way to make an educated guess is to check the company's market capitalization.\n\nIf the market cap is large enough to be included in Russell 1000, probably it made to Russell 1000. If the company's market cap is smaller compared to large 1000, it will be included in Russell 2000.\n\nI believe UWMC's market capital is large enough to be included in Russell 1000.\n\nPlease be aware that Russell 2000 is not better than Russell 3000.

Although short squeezes may seem simple, they are a bit complex when you *look under the hood.* This publication is meant to graphically show how short squeezes happen as well providing the mechanics on why they occur.\n\n**The mechanics behind longs and shorts**\n\nTo understand short squeezes we have to understand the mechanics of *longs* and *shorts.* Most investors usually invest using by *going long* on a stock. This is when an investor purchases the stock and then hopefully sells it a higher price in the future. A *short seller* is when an individual wants to bet against a stock hoping that it falls. But instead of selling the stock at a higher price for a profit, they want to *buy the stock back* at a lower price, we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll get more into the short positions if this seems confusing now.\n\nShort sellers have all sort of motives, some short sellers are actively trying to take down companies (see activist [short sellers](https://www.hec.edu/en/knowledge/articles/how-activist-short-sellers-police-financial-markets#:~:text=Activist%20short%20sellers%20are%20a,corporate%20frauds%20or%20financial%20misstatements.)), some do it because they think the stock is overvalued, and others may do it to hedge out their portfolio (see [long short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp#:~:text=Long%2Dshort%20equity%20is%20an%20investment%20strategy%20that%20seeks%20to,%2Dvalued%20and%20over%2Dvalued.) strategy).\n\nWe won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t dive too deep on longs and shorts but below covers the relevant material to understand them. Here is a *simple* process for entering longs and shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flhcbdv51p471.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b1a38557bb176decff9dca745e2118f3cbe623\n\nTo reiterate the most important part of these positions are\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siavo5961p471.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f447c0639e8693a0f9e4ba887a0b76327470718\n\nWe can see that an investor that goes long has to **buy** to get into the position, and **sell,** to get out of the position. And a short seller has to **sell** to get into a position and **buy** to get out. (The technical terms for the short seller are **selling short,** and **buying to cover**).\n\n**Price Discovery Analysis**\n\nTo analyze a stock\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price we will use the price discovery method. We\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll start with a standard supply and demand curve for modeling stock prices. Although this explanation works in theory and the mechanics behind this model are applicable in real life, it is technically impossible to know the future movement of supply and demand curves. To do so would require one to know all of current and potential investors\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 future decisions, which are hard to predict.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2a50m371p471.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de58d6059ff1b46277d814224cbdae8f6538fe1\n\nIn this simple representation where supply stays constant, an increase in demand leads to a higher price and a decrease in demand leads to a lower price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zviv8r71p471.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=6832c9ff03e755ef89c5c94028f8a31dbcd3ef2e\n\nEven though keeping supply constant is **not technically accurate,** it provides for a better visual explanation later\\*\\*.\\*\\* In general, changes in supply would mean that there are less or more sellers in the market.\n\n**Orderbook analysis**\n\nTo analyze movements in the stock we will examine the *orderbook*, which displays the type of order and the quantity of orders for a certain price. It shows how prices change with incoming bids and asks. The *bids* are the orders to buy the stock and the and the *asks* are the orders to sell the stock. In stock trading there is usually a slight difference between bids and asks (the *spread*), we can see that the spread between the highest bid ($125.82) and the lowest ask ($126.80). A *transaction* doesn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t occur until bid and ask agree upon a price (which would look like an order on each side of the price). So in this case if you were looking to buy the stock you would have to meet the lowest ask which is $126.80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uaq33l81p471.png?width=236&format=png&auto=webp&s=a599b5d90613f08f5a053d54d33e0d7e67bdfa56\n\nThis is a sample orderbook that I found from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/). A live orderbook would be filled with a number of bids and asks in each column. Orderbook information can be found in your brokerage account if you have access to level II market data. I like to think of orderbook dynamics as forces moving against each other. For example if there are more buyers than sellers then, the green vector will be bigger than the red vector which will push the price up. If there are more sellers than buyers then the red vector will be bigger, which will push prices down.\n\nThe following is a different visual representation of bids and asks that shows volume. Looking at the bids (*green)* we can see that there is a preference to buy the stock at a lower price. As for the asks (*red*) the majority of sellers are looking to sell the stock at higher price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48bp2v491p471.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5e87c7ed77f97c6951b30cac740d3469e063406\n\n**Gamestop Example**\n\nNow let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s get into the mechanics behind a short squeeze, and in this case we will look at the Gamestop short squeeze which garnered a great deal of attention recently.\n\nIn this example we will start with 7 short positions. Each short position comes from a different short seller. We can see on the aggregate that the stock is downward trending for the most part. This works in the best interest of the short seller who **sells the stock and hopes to buy it back at a cheaper price**, and they will profit from the **difference**. We can also see that the short sell positions are represented with the *green* *profit bar* below the price they entered in at.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojczn2t91p471.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65987f0347a0ce2bed614323ceccab066a83f3cf\n\nNow let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s talk about how the short seller\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s position may go awry. If the stock price increases which isn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t what the short seller wants and they begin to lose money, then are going to want to exit their position. Keep in mind that **exiting** a short position requires **buying** the stock back. This is *the bug* in short selling, its this little feature that creates a short squeeze. Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s say a short seller wants out, they\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll buy the stock back, but also going back to our price discovery method, buying a stock **increases the demand**, which **increases the price**.\n\nThis is where the squeeze occurs, each short seller **exits** their position which pushes the price up, causing the next short seller to lose money.\n\nThe timeline of trades would look like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qu3rdfma1p471.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cfe11ab1b3d42c0340167076f541828a48f62\n\nGraphically it would look like this with the price on left side and the supply and demand on the right side. We can see that when the short seller buys the stock back they increase the demand which increases price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og7139gb1p471.png?width=1891&format=png&auto=webp&s=d505e0a7ddc97c446fd4cf90f6beb413dec217d8\n\nWe can see that when this all starts to happen the price can dramatically increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zvr183c1p471.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c50d93d517fff2c4c6d58d27b7761cd358452f4\n\n**Why Short Squeezes happen**\n\nThe main factor that contributes to short squeezes is that a short seller who is looking to exit their position has to **buy** the stock which pushes the price up, and that hits the next seller and so forth.\n\nSome short squeezes may occur naturally, although they rarely do. This can happen if a stock posts good quarterly results or makes a positive announcement. That increase in price could trigger a short squeeze. For example when famed activist short seller Citron Research ran by Andrew Left switched his short position on Tesla Inc, that created a short squeeze(see [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/23/short-seller-who-is-suing-tesla-changes-his-mind-tesla-is-destroying-the-competition.html)).\n\nIf short sellers succeed and push the price of the stock down then there is a risk that a short squeeze may occur. *Contrarian investors* which are investors that take *go against the grain* approach in investing may bet on a company who\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price is falling. Their purchase may cause a short squeeze, and its common for contrarian investors to try and garner public support which would rally investors. Value investors who constantly ask \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3*is this stock overvalued or undervalued?\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8* may see a stock that has been falling because of short sellers and say that its undervalued and buy up a bunch of shares causing a short squeeze.\n\nBut the most famous short squeezes that are studied come from market manipulation. This occurs when a trader or group of traders realize that with a large enough buy order will push the price up triggering a short squeeze.\n\nAlthough it feels like short squeezes have been happening a lot with talks about *meme stocks*, they actually don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t occur too often. I would assume that as markets calm when our lives fully revert back to normal (or whatever normal is post-pandemic) there will be less of these events.", "votes": 91, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9977, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 20:08:52", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:06:38", "reddit_post_id": "nxozgb"}, "1124": {"post_id": 15418, "author_id": 252321, "post_title": "Betting 29 Honda Civics ($645K) that GME rockets by November $800 calls", "self_text": "Obligatory yes I'm that idiot who keeps pissing money away.

They are at record highs right now, but there is no reason to believe that they will experience a significant drop in the future, actually the opposite is more probable. The big surge in steel prices started in the middle of last year, cuz companies that work  in the automobile industry,infrastructure, manufacturing etc. managed to start operating at full capacity, way faster than most material producers( steel included). However, this trend should continue in the future, cuz demand is simply outpacing the supply due to several macroeconomic factors. We are witnessing a manufacturing and infrastructure boom in the whole world, especially in Asia where governments are spending huge money for infrastructure projects and with Biden's 3 trillion plan it seems that America is trying to catch up. Also, the largest steel manufacturer in the world China is trying everything it can to suppress steel exports ( on May 1st they removed the tax rebate on steel exports) due to the large domestic demand. Furthermore, China is trying to become a more environmentally friendly country and may be forced to close some steel plants( chinese and indian steel plants are technologically behind U.S ones and pollute way more) especially with the 2022 Olympics knocking on the door. When it comes to the U.S, the situation is not very different and it does not look like Biden will remove the tariffs on steel imports imposed by Trump any time soon. I mean we need to protect( get the votes of) the rust belt workers, right?\n\nAnother reason why steel prices might continue to surge is simply due to the consolidation in the steel industries in Europe and U.S . After CLF bought the Arcellor Mittal steel business in the U.S, the four  biggest steel manufacturers are responsible for more than 80 percent of the steel production in America. When there are less players in an industry they have more control of the price. Also, they have the ability to operate only their newest plants, which are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.  Shipping costs are also through the roof this year, so if you are an american company it is probably better to buy domestic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy CLF is a good bet? CLF is a fully vertically integrated primary steel producer. They not only produce the steel, but they also mine the Iron Ore needed to create steel. That means that they have better margins that most competitors and with the sky-high steel prices they are literally printing money. They have a large portfolio of different steel products and even sell to other steel manufacturers. Also their plants are very high-tech ( faster production, lower cost, less emissions).  \n\nNow let's take a look at the company's financials.  In the last quarter they reported revenue of 4 billion, compared to 359 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 513 million compared to 23 million. Yes, Covid definitely affected the performance in 2020, but even compared to 2019 the results are monstrous. CLF also has forward P/E ratio of 3.51 which is lower than the industry average and PEG ratio of 0.18 ( I have never seen a company with so low PEG) . Their debt to equity ratio is bigger than the industry average for now , but that is not  necessarily a bad thing. In finance class they teach you that if your  internal rate of return is higher than the interest rate then you are good. CLF probably bought the AM steel business at the best time and it comes as no surprise  that they plan to payback debt aggressively this year. I also think that some investors undervalue the company and do not see its true potential due to the fact that it became a vertically integrated steel producer pretty soon. The CEO-Goncalves had something to say about that in the last earnings call:  \n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00a3Q1 was just the first full quarter for Cleveland-Cliffs as a fully transformed business, and we have already accomplished a lot. This being said, and with all the operational and commercial actions we have been implementing, the best will come through during the balance of 2021.\"\n\nMr. Goncalves added: \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3As the year progresses, it will become abundantly clear that the pricing environment we are in - and will continue to benefit from going forward - is not a consequence of luck. Our expectation of $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the full-year is predicated on conservative pricing expectations relative to today\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s pricing and the current forward curve. This will allow us to generate record levels of free cash flow and pay down a substantial amount of debt, allowing us to reach leverage of less than 1x by the end of the year.\"", "votes": 81, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9927, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 21:53:44", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:06:49", "reddit_post_id": "nxra0u"}, "1134": {"post_id": 15428, "author_id": 619840, "post_title": "The Great Gap Fill Play: $ E B I X (Chart Update for $15+ Upmove)", "self_text": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6jjfr0trn471.png?width=2791&format=png&auto=webp&s=5969548b1dfd888b7b80dc6799d912fd2f40ec8f\n\nSince [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nweqj8/greatest_gap_fill_of_all_time_e_b_i_x_only_23m/), the chart has been playing out perfectly and price is set for a quick move to fill the gap.\n\n**Technical Analysis Update:**\n\n* Price has officially confirmed that the $34.00 level turned from resistance into support.

It's down over 50% from it's pre-merger highs and dipped well below it's former NAV of $10. The big question is : why?\n\nThe news of their cancelled deal with Hyundai during their first earnings call is what caused the most recent downward move, but was it really negative news? Why have your engineers work for another car company, helping them develop a car and giving them your valuable IP? It makes more sense to focus on your own products, which will lead to much more revenue over the years. \n\nTheir original CEO, Ulrich Kranz, leaving was also a contributor to this movement. But again, the move makes sense. Ulrich is an iconic engineer and designer. That's where his focus should be. Having him step down and putting a business oriented CEO (Tony Aquila) is the right move. Not every engineer is Elon Musk. Kranz decided not to retain an engineering position with Canoo, leading me to...\n\n **Apple Hires Ulrich Kranz for It's Rebooted Car Project** [see here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous)\n\nLots of speculations can be made here. If Ulrich had left on bad terms, most speculation would be bad.\n\nHowever, both publicly stated the departure was made on GOOD terms. \n\nAs you know, Apple tried to acquire Canoo in early 2020, which means their technology is the real deal. What do I think they're targeting? Canoo's **Skateboard Platform**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vrul6ibmo471.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6448dc4281f18423835ddb8ac2d068b03e7f9c3\n\nIf Apple had this, it would speed up their creation of the Apple car since they would only have to design the piece that goes on top. And since Apple couldn't buy Canoo, how could they get their hand on this?    Hire Ulrich and have him make one? : No, Canoo has their technology (a.k.a Ulrich's own tech) patented. \n\nI speculate a deal is in the works where Canoo licenses out their skateboard platform to Apple to build a car on in exchange for some royalty they receive for each sale. And hiring Ulrich Kranz helps them because he knows how to build a car on the platform because **HE MADE IT.**\n\nOf course this is highly speculative, but I believe it's the simplest explanation.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. **Investor Day**\n\nCanoo is holding their Investor Day next week on the 17th in Texas where they are actually letting investors attend and see their vehicles. They currently have 3 that we know of : the delivery van, pickup truck, and lifestyle vehicle(a.k.a minivan or BANGBUS). They have teased a sedan model in the past, and it's speculated they will unveil it at this event.\n\n2. **Manufacturing Announcement**\n\nCanoo's CEO said that their contract manufacturer would be announced in Q3, likely during the Q2 earnings call. This is the only thing holding them back right now. Their product is much further developed compared to the other former SPAC EV's, with 3 models that have drive-able prototypes. They may provide an update to us during Investor day.\n\n**Long and Behold: The Short Interest**\n\nOrtex is showing a current short interest rate of 30% of the share float, up 300% from their 10% short interest rate in January. They are betting against Canoo, and there are a few upcoming catalyst that could drastically change the market sentiment and blow them up.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis post contains highly speculative predictions, and I encourage you to read up on Canoo and do your own research.

Wasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t that just a rumor?**\n\n* Apple was absolutely interested in Canoo. There\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s no question about that at this point, and you should slap anyone who suggests it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s a debate.\n* This January 2021 [article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev) lays it all out, but I like you guys, so here\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s the TLDR:\n   * Apple was talking to Canoo because they wanted their patent-pending skateboard.\n   * Apple was interested in investing in, or buying them.\n   * Canoo didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t want to sell.\n   * Talks fell apart.\n\n**Didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t Apple ghost Canoo?**\n\n* We don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know who ghosted who. The article only says \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3talks fell apart.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 But we have enough information to speculate on why they didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t get a deal done.\n   * According to [The latest Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous), Apple wanted to buy Canoo, but Canoo was like \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3nah, we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re good\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8.\n   * Wut? Why the fuck would Canoo say no to Apple?\n   * We don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t know for sure, but if we assume the execs at Canoo are logical, rational business-people, it would have been some variation of \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3fuck that, we can make more money if we do it ourselves.\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8\n   * It\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s also possible the talks never advanced to the stage of Apple making or discussing the parameters of an offer, but there are a few reasons I find that hard to believe:\n\n1. Apple has $204B IN CASH. There\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s no way they would have been \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3priced out\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 of buying Canoo if they wanted them bad enough. Canoo\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s market cap is $2.3B. Apple could pull that out of the cushions of the lobby couches in Cupertino.\n2. This is when smooth brains say, \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3yeah, see, that proves Apple didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t want to buy them!\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8\n3. Sure, that\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s one way to read it, but if that were true, why did one of the most valuable companies in the history of mankind trip over their multi-hundred-billion dollar dick to hire the dude who co-founded Canoo and created the skateboard to HELP RUN THEIR ENTIRE CAR BUSINESS within weeks of him hitting the market?\n4. The most logical answer is: they LOVED the technology he helped to create at Canoo and wanted as much of it as they could get their hands on without getting sued into the abyss, and hiring Kranz allowed them to buy the brain behind the patents, if not the technology.\n5. At a minimum, they value his expertise and want him to help them create (or refine) something similar to what he created at GOEV.\n6. But there\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s at least one other reason they may have been so eager to hire Canoo\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s former CEO.\n7. Because they still want the skateboard, and no one would be better positioned to help them integrate GOEV\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s team and technology into Apple\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s plans than the guy who co-founded and led the company.\n\n**But Canoo fired the former CEO right? Why would he want to work with them now?**\n\n* Well, he definitely wasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t fired, but among us CanooBros, the working hypothesis is he was pushed out because GOEV's new CEO Tony Tequila wanted to run the show.\n* Now, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m petty af and wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t want to work with anyone A) named Tony Tequila, or B) who pushed me out of the company I fucking co-founded and built from the ground up.\n* But Canoo\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s former CEO is the ultimate wrinkle-brain ([seriously, just look at this picture of his galaxy-sized brain cavity](https://images.app.goo.gl/pfNL8UuCZRBT4TCk7)), and assuming he\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s more emotionally mature than me \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 a five year old \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 then he might realize he could make a metric-fuck-ton of money by swallowing his pride and helping Apple to get a deal done with Canoo.\n* Adding fuel to that fire, he still owns at least 1,257,987 shares of GOEV, which is currently worth $12.3M, and would assuredly multiply if a deal between Apple + Canoo got done.\n* **Disclaimer**: There could be all kinds of reasons this is a stupid hypothesis, from Apple\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s internal corporate policy on self-dealing to laws that preclude this kind of transaction from occurring, but I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m not smart enough to figure that shit out, so if someone drops legit proof that this outcome is an impossibility, I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ll edit for accuracy and clarity.\n\n**SO UR SAYIN APPLE n CANOO MAKE CAR TOGETHER AND APES GIT LAMBOS?**\n\n* No, I am absolutely not saying this is *going* to happen.

WallStBets know that if they let GME drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. This is 100% the next rip. Also, I absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. Old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the DOW on their quotrons.\n\nNow, let's look at the technicals. Here's where shit gets interesting...\n\n**PRICE ACTION** First off, we need to analyze the price action of GME and right off the bat we see a MASSIVE gap right at $305. Short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. That is if however we transition from these irrelevant CLOV and BB stocks and roll over our gains into GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpo9521b6o471.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f7400664a94226b38f8a05473aedfa4c5732b2\n\nAlso, RSI starting to taper. Historically GME has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so I'm not surprised to see a dip right here. The thing is however that GME absolutely crushed earnings. The previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low.\n\n**FIBS** This spot right here is the single greatest Fib retracement I have ever seen. Hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the \"Golden Trade\". The support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a T, so we can expect a reversal is coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzanblgd6o471.png?width=2966&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a00856592e36dd8117faeec6d5d2defc56a5f6\n\n**OPTION VOL** Now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. You can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. Let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. This is due to the Hedge Funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. Options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. If my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when GME is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddyujvsf6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=61100491a89df316ba04aa8814d94fe9c1695138\n\n**PC RATIO** Put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in July? That's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. You can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. The problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d33w9csi6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a5cfbbd65b91f320a5577194e229b049ca6d48\n\nIf you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. WallStBets is an organization that I believe will not go down without a fight, and I see them planning a massive rally with GME through their instagram and twitter pages. What you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of WallStBets are absolutely BANKING on the shit that is ripping. A lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see \"BUY GME CANNOT GO TITS UP\" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their Robinhood account expiring next week. At the end of the day, do your own due diligence. The stock is cheap right now and I'm definitely buying. I believe in WallStBets and I think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history.

It is the shares outstanding divided by total number of shareholders. This includes institutions, insiders and shareholders abroad. Pay special attention to shareholders abroad, as I will explain this later. First we will look at the numbers.\n\n\\---> BREAK DOWN OF THE AVERAGE SHARE CALCULATION <---\n\n501,780,240 Shares outstanding\n\n/ 4,100,000 Shareholders eligible to vote\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 122 Shares in average for all shareholders using outstanding shares\n\nThis is what AA gave us and he rounded down to 120 shares in average for both institutions, insiders and retail investors. The number of institutions is 397 and insiders 35 and these are therefore negligible compared to the millions of retail investors, and thus they do not matter in the average share calculations.\n\nWe know officially that there was 103 millions reported shares borrowed and sold short May 28th. These shares all have new owners and could be added to the float being held.\n\n501,780,240 Shares outstanding May 27th\n\n\\+ 102,300,000 Reported shorts May 27th\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 604,080,240 Shares officially held\n\nUsing this the average held shares can be calculated like this:\n\n604,080,240 Shares officially held\n\n/ 4,100,000 Shareholders eligible to vote\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 147 Shares in average for all shareholders using official reported shorts\n\nSo this is the absolute minimum of average held shares. In an ideal market with full transparency this would be the real number. Spoiler: It is NOT!\n\nNow, let's go back in time and make the same calculation for another key date, the 11th of March.\n\n450,160,000 Shares outstanding March 11th\n\n/ 3,200,000 Shareholders eligible to vote\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 140 Shares in average for all shareholders using outstanding shares\n\n450,160,000 Shares outstanding March 11th\n\n\\+ 49,310,000 Reported shorts as of March 31st\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 499,470,000 Shares officially held\n\nUsing this the average held shares as of 11th of March becomes\n\n499,470,000 Shares officially held\n\n/ 3,200,000 Shareholders eligible to vote\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 156 Shares in average for all shareholders using official reported shorts\n\nSo, using AA's official tweet an average ape held about 140 shares March 11th and 120 June 2nd. Using the officially reported shorts an average ape held 156 shares in Match and now they hold an average of 147.\n\nAND THIS OF COURSE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I HAVE ONLY ADDED TO MY POSITION. I'M 100% CONFIDENT THAT APES HAVE ONLY ADDED TO THEIR POSITION. WE HAVE BOUGHT THE DIPS AND WE HAVE BOUGHT THE RIPS!\n\nSo we owned the float already in March and not just once. Now we own it even more. I have tippled down since then. I know others have too. I hold for you and you hold for me.\n\nSO LIKE WE ALL KNOW: WE HAVE WON. WE WILL MOON. MOASS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!\n\nIf the number of shares were actually reported to AMC in the shareholder count, it would have at least included all the shorts (as a short creates a new share and it also has a buyer and therefore is an actual share held by a shareholder).\n\nI 100% believe that AA and AMC is using the outstanding shares because they have been advised to by their lawyers and possibly SEC running an investigation. AA (like all of us) knows that the officially reported shorts is underreported and shorts are hidden in ITM calls, FTDs, naked shorts, synthetics etc. lets called them all phantom shares.\n\n\\--> BREAK DOWN OF THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS <--\n\nAA has said that retail now own more than 80% of the shares. On May 4th AA said that retail owned 80% already on March 11th count. Since then we have grown by 28%.\n\nLet's break down the 4,100,000 shareholders. A person living in the US and Canada count as 1 shareholder. But a person living abroad (like me) are mainly counted through proxy (we can not vote and our shares are stored all together at our broker), meaning that the 15.000 shareholders at my broker (Nordnet) only count as 1 shareholder. Also it means that the growth of 28% is only in the US.\n\n4,100,00 Shareholders June 2nd\n\n\\- 3,200,000 Shareholders March 11th\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n= 900,000 More shareholders in the US and Canada\n\nThe US is as Borat would say \"The Greatest Country in the World\", but the majority of the Worlds population lives outside the US. I would not be surprised if there are 50% or 100% more shareholders living outside the US.\n\n\\--> ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES <--\n\nThe polls made by Matt, Trey and more have given us an insight in the number of shares held as of 4th of May 2012. I can't remember what they were at the time of writing this and they have likely grown as most are using every salary to buy additional shares.\n\n125 shares x 4 million HODLERS = 500 million shares (500 outstanding, 0 short, 0 naked shorts)\n\n150 shares x 4 million HODLERS = 600 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 0 naked shorts)\n\n150 shares x 6 million HODLERS = 900 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 300 naked shorts)\n\n200 shares x 6 million HODLERS = 1200 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 600 naked shorts)\n\n200 shares x 8 million HODLERS = 1600 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 1000 naked shorts)\n\n300 shares x 8 million HODLERS = 2400 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 1800 naked shorts)\n\nI think we own AMC not one time, not two times, not three times, not four times....It's more and we own AMC like a lot!\n\nTLDR;\n\nThe 4,1 million shareholders as of June 2nd includes institutions and insiders in the US, CANADA and mainly brokers abroad, not individuals abroad. There are easily 50% or 100% more apes owning shares in AMC. That is 6-8 million shareholders!!\n\nThe average of 120 shares held as of June 2nd would have been 140 shares as of March 11th. AA confirmed yesterday that he simply used the outstanding shares. Hereby he confirms that he is not counting synthetics or even legal shorts.\n\nWe are dumb money, but we are smart enough to understand that AMC cannot legally tell us this that Shitadel is STEALING as they say in TEXAS. There is an ongoing SEC investigation.\n\nThe numbers proves that almost nobody has sold since March. We are more apes than ever. We have added to their position through dips and rips. We owned AMC in March and we own AMC in June.\n\nAMC is owned by apes multiple times. There must be billions of phantom shares for it all to add up. I'M MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER!\n\nSO LIKE WE ALL KNOW: WE HAVE WON. WE WILL MOON. MOASS WILL BE SPECTACULAR. MOON I'LL SEE YOU SOON! HODL!\n\nNot financial advice, I'm plain dumb and only an even dumber retard would not take this with a grain of salt on a banana!

As a Type 1 diabetic, I'm on some sentimental shit with SENS and why the shorts can get rekt. \n\n\n*  Diabetes is a serious, long-term condition with a major impact on the lives and well-being of around 500MM individuals globally\n   *  This half a billion number is projected to increase by 25% in 2030 and 51% in 2045\n* Diabetes is among the top 10 causes of death in adults, and it was estimated to have caused four million deaths globally in 2017 \n* In 2019, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes -- 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose in 2012 \n\nHere's the thing... Deaths and major complications caused by diabetes are 100% preventable with the right technology to help manage blood glucose levels.  Companies like SENS are literally saving lives with their technology.   I can personally say that continuous glucose monitoring significantly reduces the burden of living with diabetes and improves quality of life, and I'm grateful that diabetes technology has come so far. \n\nEven if you don't give a shit about the sentimental value of seeing SENS succeed, the market for its products is sizeable, given that this chronic illness affects nearly 500MM people. \n\nTLDR: Fuck Diabetes. Fuck the shorts. Buy $SENS. \n\nSee you on the blood moon.

At first sight you might think $SENS has the makings of a meme stock with no intrinsic value. It was trading as low as 0.4 just three months ago before multiplying more than 10x in just 2 months. Besides, it had only $4.9 in revenues last year a drop of 80% in revenues from the year before! Normally, after reading these two data points I would stop researching any company, but there is more than meets the eye to this story so hang on. The situation for Senseonics was not always like that. This company has been public since 2015 and it is not a newly founded company, Senseonics was founded in 1996 and has invested all this time developing their technology and getting patents and authorizations. It has 519 issued patents and pending patent applications related to their CGM system and has burned through $648 MM since its inception just to get to where we are now. The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale. Therefore, there's a lot of upside for SENS including a potential short squeeze which may happen as the short interest is more than 25%.\n\nTL;DR: your wife's boyfriend said if you buy SENS you get to leave the basement", "votes": 36, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": -0.9774, "date_posted": "2021-06-12 00:58:26", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:07:34", "reddit_post_id": "nxuu06"}, "1176": {"post_id": 15470, "author_id": 557096, "post_title": "ASO gain so far", "self_text": "", "votes": 27, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5267, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 15:06:47", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:07:35", "reddit_post_id": "nxi5op"}, "1177": {"post_id": 15471, "author_id": 613269, "post_title": "$wish I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m soo fucked I gained 3000 last week had jul 16 calls sold em for 6/18 calls can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t even make rent this month", "self_text": "", "votes": 70, "post_title_sentiment": -0.4215, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-12 02:28:06", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:07:36", "reddit_post_id": "nxwf4o"}, "1178": {"post_id": 15472, "author_id": 282054, "post_title": "It's not too late $ASO is far from done.", "self_text": "", "votes": 27, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 15:24:09", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:07:38", "reddit_post_id": "nxik5u"}, "1179": {"post_id": 15473, "author_id": 564615, "post_title": "A beautiful Partnership between Gamestop and Corsair (GME + CRSR)", "self_text": "We should get this movement started and the idea out there. Gamestop has had talks of getting more into the PC gaming and streaming market. Who would be great for that? Corsair (CRSR). This would be absolutely huge and I could see something like this potentially happening in the future as Gamestop looks for new ways to innovate itself. It would be awesome to see Gamestop introduce more PC gaming into its lineup of products along with the streaming side of things in retail stores and its website. Currently Corsair is one of the leading PC component, gaming and streaming suppliers. A partnership between these two to offer all of its product lineup would not only help both of their stock prices but would increase revenues and growth for both companies. It almost seems like a no brainer and I'm surprised something like this has not happened yet. I say we get this trending! I am currently invested in both and probably will be YOLOing a shitload more into CRSR and GME this next week and going into the end of the month. I also will tag Ryan Cohen, Gamestop and Corsair across different platforms to see if they would respond and be open to the idea. If enough people push the concept maybe they will listen after all alot of us are shareholders.\n\nCRSR currently sits undervalued and unoticed at 32.76 a share. Has not even hit the lowest analyst price target, has a very small float and the potential for a major surge as more investors and traders jump on board and buy up the float. Current market Cap is 2.97B, Revenues are increasing substantially year over year and new products rolling off the line steadily. This will catch up with Logitech in no time in my opinion.\n\nGME currently sitting at 237.10 a share with a slightly larger but small float aswell. Possibly going into the Russell 1000 will be a big catalyst. Add these two together and you have Magic and a beautiful catalyst for both.

To hedge against my puts I will simply buy different stocks for dam Construction companies, which will rise nevertheless since atleast some cities/countries will (try to) build a dam. This alone is imo already a great play since you won't be called a \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557 by your friends/family and building huge dams is unbelievable expensive (see cost of Delta Works: 20% of the GDP of Netherlands). \n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk, hopefully I didn't cause too many wrinkles in your brain.\n\nTLDR: Temperatur rises -> sea level rises -> cities sink (buy puts/short them) -> hedge against this by investing in dam construction companies\n\nFor bowling ball brains: \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00f9\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00bf\u00d4\u00d7\u00ed\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00f6\u00d1\u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ec\u00d4\u00d7\u00ed\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00e8\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00d8\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00d6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00d4\u00d7\u00ed\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00d8\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00c5\u00d6\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00f4\u00eb\u00d4\u00d7\u00ed\u00b4\u00a9\u00c5\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557\u00ad\u0192\u00c6\u00a9\u00ad\u0192\u00f1\u00e6\n\nPS: You can call me a \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00ea\u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u2557 all you want, deep down you know I am right.\n\n@MODS where did the shitpost flair go?", "votes": 13, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9862, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 13:38:22", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:07:57", "reddit_post_id": "nxg6zc"}, "1199": {"post_id": 15493, "author_id": 263924, "post_title": "Magnaship Semiconductor Receives Higher Bid $35 a Share", "self_text": " I called the MX or Magnachip buyout here on WSB 3 months ago:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35pbh/1\\_billion\\_mkt\\_cap\\_mods\\_check\\_googleyahoo\\_deep/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35pbh/1_billion_mkt_cap_mods_check_googleyahoo_deep/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbhb2a/best\\_oled5g\\_value\\_play\\_mx\\_magnachip\\_makes\\_oled/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbhb2a/best_oled5g_value_play_mx_magnachip_makes_oled/)\n\nNow, the South Korean leader in display and power solutions, today confirmed receipt of an unsolicited proposal for $35 a share.\n\n[https://investors.magnachip.com/news-releases/news-release-details/magnachip-confirms-receipt-unsolicited-proposal](https://investors.magnachip.com/news-releases/news-release-details/magnachip-confirms-receipt-unsolicited-proposal)\n\nTo recap, MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. Their chips power the display in smartphones\n\nOLEDs are booming:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/ga8351tvqso61.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=522d1d40be7e52d5b2e4497fecd471292e708f7e](https://preview.redd.it/ga8351tvqso61.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=522d1d40be7e52d5b2e4497fecd471292e708f7e)\n\nA few last things... (if you get this innuendo, good job):\n\n1. A Korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want\n\n* OLED Screen\n* 120hz HFR\n* LPTO Displays\n\n1. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)\n2. OLED is here, gaming console usage could become a very large upside opportunity. The Nintendo Switch (upcoming) will have a OLED display (albeit a lower end one, called rigid OLED compared to ones in iPhones)\n\nMX is poised to generate $60-$70mm in EBITDA in 2021, so at the $35 it is still quite reasonably valued.

This could be interpreted in a lot of ways - but it almost always leads to pushing good money into riskier and riskier assets. Also, it could make banks more skeptical about lending money, since their is no incentive to take the risk to lend money, when the credit spread is narrowing. Less lending activity in the economy = less economic activity = disinflationary.\n\nNow the 'mainstream' narrative is 10Y is falling because of low inflation expectations. But there are bigger factors at play. The large amount of money sloshing around is stressing the banks. They can't accept any more cash as deposits. They are already full. That's why reverse repo exchanges are skyrocketing recently @ 0% rate. They just want to park at cash with Fed, even if it yields nothing.\n\nNegative rates in short duration bonds is forcing the banks (GSIBs) into buying long duration treasury bonds. No surprise we are seeing a bond rally right now, and it may only be beginning.\n\nThe banks, the bond market, most likely wants Fed to taper. It will make the things normal again and take off the stress from banks. But will Fed do it? The next FOMC meeting next week is going to be interesting.\n\nTwo outcomes:\n\n1) If Fed tapers\n\nThe short duration yield will most likely rise and that will lift the long duration bond yield as well. Dollar will rally and commodities and stonks will experience a correction (highly likely)\n\n2) If Fed doesn't taper\n\nStatus quo remains intact. The 10Y will keep falling until banks (GSIBs) run out of money and Fed is forced to taper abruptly. Narrowing credit spreads will dampen economic activity. Meaning no extravagant earnings growth = forward PE doesn't expand and maybe even shrinks. Money continues to flow into riskier and riskier assets: like junk bonds, meme stocks, conventional stocks.

The company just saved $78M in operating costs, by paying $1.1B in debt and refinancing $931M of debt with a 1.25% lower interest rate. Paysafe is a powerhouse next to Marqeta. By many statements mostly from amazing DD done by Lincoln, the stock should be at $46 per share, or $33B. Using the simple math Marqeta is case in point being overvalued, and one of many examples now how Paysafe is undervalued. So what is happening?

Their Augmented Reality wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include cameras, sensors, and a computer that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, social media or entertainment applications. Their wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, which when viewed through their smart glasses\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6 products create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Vuzix's offered products are M series Smart Glasses, Blade Smart Glasses and other Augmented Reality Products. \n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/c3ti8rur3l471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=34bc91ac94ae2222d80509ff6bf28a79a9a101f9)\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5wzplvts3l471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0cb851563c399302cbdc99671121023eeab90a9)\n\nSales of Smart Glasses products for the year ended December 31, 2020 rose by 107% over the same period in 2019, primarily the result of stronger customer demand for the new M-Series models, which were not available for sale for the entire comparable period in 2019. Sales revenues from the M-Series Smart Glasses were $8,406,623, a 112% increase of $4,432,628 over the prior year\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s comparable period. Total M-Series unit sales increased by 109% for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the same period in 2019. Revenues of Blade Smart Glasses decreased by $240,747 or 14%, primarily driven by lower average sales price as compared to 2019.\n\nSales of OEM Products, and Standalone Waveguides and Display Engines were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $951,570 and $152,499, respectively, in the 2019 period primarily due to not receiving new orders.\n\nSales of Engineering Services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,500,287 as compared to $673,151 in the 2019 comparable period. The revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 for engineering services was primarily a result of several waveguide and display engine development projects which commenced in the first and second quarters of 2020. The majority, all but two, of these projects were completed and delivered in 2020. \n\n**BULL ARGUMENT**\n\nAugmented Reality Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer-generated information, graphics or images projected into the real-world environment or upon an object that the user is observing. Thus, whether in the warehouse, on the factory floor, or in the field, users wearing Augmented Reality Smart Glasses may access a manual, tutorial, or image that is connected to the task at hand which will assist them in completing that task, while also viewing their current surroundings and nearby objects. Additional possible applications of AR-enabled Smart Glasses include hands-free alerts, messaging, location and context aware information and social interaction.\n\nVuzix has developed their own intellectual property portfolio that includes [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/vuzix-corporation), over 22 years of manufacturing know-how, software, proprietary processes, materials and equipment to create high performance waveguides, and near-eye display products. It can be argued their waveguides and compact display engine technologies are a key differentiator for enabling next generation Augmented Reality and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and consumer segments because they will ultimately allow Vuzix to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses.\n\nKey growth areas for Vuzix are the enterprise, medical, consumer electronics, OEM, defense and security markets. They are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling their own finished products and building a growing eco-system of software and services internally and with their value added resellers, developers and end customers. Another potential channel to these markets they are developing includes supplying mass production of waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products. Vuzix recently announced they will expand their Augmented Reality surgical product presence to [support shoulder, knee, and spinal surgeries](https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1895/vuzix-smart-glasses-expand-ar-surgical-product-presence-to). \n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nVuzix has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses. They reported a net loss of $17,952,172 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $26,476,370 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a net loss of $21,875,713 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Vuzix has an accumulated deficit of $162,694,983 as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThey operate in a highly competitive market and the size, resources, and brand name of some of their competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than Vuzix. Some competitors include: \n\n* Samsung Electronics Co.\n* LG Electronics \n* Epson\n* Sony Corporation\n* Microsoft Corporation\n* Oculus/Facebook\n* HTC Corporation\n* Snap\n* Lenovo\n* Google\n* Magic Leap\n\nMany of their competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, research and development resources. Additionally, many of these competitors also have substantial competitive advantages such as: \n\n* longer operating histories\n* the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products\n* broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners\n* access to larger established customer bases and known branding\n* greater resources to fund research and development and to make acquisitions\n* larger intellectual property portfolios\n* the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI have a hard time pulling the trigger on a long-term investment with Vuzix. With their current financials and competitors, I feel this is a better day/swing trade opportunity if played correctly. The volatility is where I like it for those types of trades. It will be interesting to see how Vuzix develops over the next 1-3 years, but I won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have positions longer than a couple weeks during that time span.\n\n*I am not a financial advisor.* *Current positions: none*", "votes": 10, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.999, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 07:10:54", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 00:08:11", "reddit_post_id": "nx9tof"}, "1213": {"post_id": 15507, "author_id": 618331, "post_title": "I want to give back to this community , i enjoy and appreciate your DDs because im nothing but smooth brained.

The possibility they may not get the additional funding required to ramp up the production phase of their operations. Worst case scenario: They could go bankrupt and this will result in hundreds of families in Lordstown, Ohio without work. However, the moment they say, \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3funding secured\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8, this stock will triple.\n\n2) Lordstown Motors future capital requirements; their ability to execute their business plan, and the risks related to the rollout of their business and the timing of expected release date for the Endurance. The Endurance is their all-electric full-size pick-up truck, the failure of this vehicle to launch successfully by the end of this year will be severely detrimental to the success of the company. **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year.**\n\n3) Lordstown Motors ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in their vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. While companies like Ford and GM have a track record of succeeding in the fleet industry, Lordstown Motors is a new upcomer, and thus, this unknown variable causes a high degree of uncertainty.\n\n4) Competition in the EV industry, from established veterans such as Ford, GM, and newcomers such as Rivian, Lucid, and others can\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t be underestimated and understated. This is a serious threat to Lordstown Motors that cannot be ignored.

First, CLNE starts the bullish run on November 9th, 2020 and peaks about February 10, 2021. It then enters a bearish trend until about May 5th. That is when it reverses into the now bullish trend that we are excited for. To analyze these trends, I used two tools, Fibonacci Retracement and Fibonacci Time Zones.\n\nWhat are these?\n\nDo they work\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa for CLNE at least? **Yes**\n\n    Overviews from investopedia.\n\n# Time Zones\n\n[Fibonacci Time Zones](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonaccitimezones.asp):\n\n    Fibonacci time zones are a technical indicator based on time. The indicator is typically started at a major swing high or swing low on the chart. Vertical lines then extend out to the right, indicating areas of time that could result in another significant swing high, low, or reversal. These vertical lines, which correspond to time on the x-axis of a price chart, are based on Fibonacci numbers.\n\n\u00d4\u00c7\u00aasuggests when reversals could occur, based on Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe vertical lines do not have to be on the money, but the chart speaks for itself. I used November 9th 2020 as the starting point, because that was the first sign of increase in volume and price from the previous trends. Also, that was the start of the first remarkable price movement in over six months. This bullish trend continued until February 2nd, 2021 with a price increase from $2.49 to $18.28\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa not bad\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa maybe it was election results and potential shift for heavy support of green energy? Either way, CLNE peaked the next day on February 3rd at $19.79. I purposefully did not set the end of the first time zone on this date because of the price action; the thicker part of the candle was higher on the 2nd, not the 3rd, which indicates a possible trend reversal. Now, go back and look at the chart and yes, CLNE reversed. The second time zone suggests that CLNE entered a bearish trend that should end around May 10th, and **wouldn\u00d4\u00c7\u00fft you know it, CLNE did**.\n\n**And this is where we are now, a possible bull run until around July 20th.**\n\n    Disclaimer: This is a broad time frame. Between May 10th and July 20th, we should see a long-term price movement UP. How far up? Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s find out. Just understand, that prices don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t just go UP: They can have corrections, trade sideways, consolidate, etc. Expect dips within this window of time.\n\n# Retracement\n\n[Fibonacci Retracement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp):\n\n    Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. They are based on Fibonacci numbers. Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used.\n\nPretty much, it assists in ~~predicting~~ **theorizing** where support and resistance levels could be based on the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThese levels are:\n\n|\\+100%|$18.785|\n|:-|:-|\n|\\+78.6%|$15.298|\n|\\+61.8%|$12.561|\n|\\+50%|$10.639|\n|\\+38.2%|$8.716|\n|\\+23.6%|$6.338|\n|0%|$2.493|\n\nThese prices should be the major support/resistance levels moving forward from **November 9th, 2020**. Now, go back and look at the chart, is it accurate? **Pretty much, every major price movement has tested these levels then bounced or broke through these prices.**\n\n# Blue Line\n\nThe blue line is where the stock took a decent in 2014 and has never come close to returning until now.\n\n    I don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t want to flood this post with too much depth on the history of the stock. I just want to point out where the stock has been and analyze where it is going. This post is about next week\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s price action.\n\n# Week of June 14th - 18th\n\n[Two-Hour Time Scale of recent price movement](https://preview.redd.it/ocb943dcnr471.jpg?width=2731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8144c525baeeea92980b71b66d071e25989a47e9)\n\nFirst the upward trend. We see a strong rise in support and volume since June 2nd. Apes take notice near June 8th and the price breaks three levels of resistance. Shorts get excited and unload. The price falls down to the\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa **50% Fibonacci Retracement** and holds support. I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m excited to see if the long-term trend from the 2nd will push the price up to retest $12.56. I suspect that if price retests that level, the price will excel beyond to a **minimum of $20.** If the price fails the retest of the 50%, the price bounced off it twice June 10th at 11:00 and 14:00, expect a dip to $9.79. On June 11th, we spent the entire day ~~on this level~~\\*\\*(Edit: at 50% level)\\*\\*. Which brings the next point.\n\nPrice has been consolidating for two days at the 50% retracement, since the price launched to $16.32 and returned after shorting. **I strongly feel that the price will not fall through the 50% retracement.** Should it though, there is a nice long-term support at the $9.79 price. Referring back to the Fibonacci chart, you will see that the price has only fell through that price once, on May 7th in the previous/**bearish** time zone. Furthermore, look at the RSI. The RSI indicates that the price has been hovering at the oversold territory since the descent on Thursday. MACD is indicating a crossover is soon. The 15-day SMA and 200-day EMA show the price is rising above the retracements and continuing a bullish trend.\n\nLet\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s make a list:\n\n* Long-term trend \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 BULLISH\n* At strong support and 50% retracement \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 BULLISH\n* Price consolidation for two days \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 Massive move soon.\n* RSI \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 Near oversold\n* MACD \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 BULLISH\n* 15-SMA/200-EMA \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 BULLISH\n* Shorts \u00d4\u00c7\u00f6 Unloaded 8.2million shares since the 8th. 800,000 available\n\n# Options\n\nEveryone was excited for the 6/18 13c because of the open interest being 30k+. Let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s look at Friday\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Holy moly! \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7](https://preview.redd.it/23ofujakur471.jpg?width=2715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fae2712acc2621e839dcd05167955c369385c3e)\n\nLook at these options. Just wow. Okay, so I fully expect the shorts to use the remaining 800,000 shares. Because even if a fraction of the shares on loan are returned, these options will instantly be in the money. Here is where the star-spangled explosion is, and finally the \u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u00e4 will go over the \u00ad\u0192\u00ee\u00d8. If there is an increase in buy pressure, you see where the ramp goes.\n\nLet me add to the previous list:\n\n* Given that the price seems it will not fall through the 50% retracement, it should go up.\n* Once the price starts to go up, these options will accelerate the price past the 100% level at $18.785.\n* The price will then be in the territory it has not seen in seven years!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    As always, do your own TA and DD. I would love for someone to poke holes into this TA. \n\nNo price targets. The price appears to want to go to the $15.298/78.6% retracement this week. If it falls through expect a bounce off $9.79 and consolidate at 50% retracement until shorts cover; then definitely 78.6% retracement.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n# So, why didn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t the \u00ad\u0192\u00c9\u00e4 go MOO-n this week?\n\n* Shorts dumped about \\~8.2million shares on the run-up, stopping the previous momentum.\n* Shorts don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t want the price above $13 **(see options chain).**\n* The price needed to retest the 50% retracement to confirm support, given the massive run this week. CLNE broke three levels of Fibonacci Retracement without retesting any of the lines.\n\n# So what about next week?\n\n* Extremely bullish.\n* \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\n* Gamma or no gamma, CLNE ~~is going to~~ **looks to** hit +$20 before July 20th.\n\n# What about that fibonacci stuff?\n\n* Bullish time zone until July 20th.\n* Currently at 50% retracement.\n* Suspect movement to 78.6% retracement sooner rather than later.\n\n# Options?\n\n\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7 past my TA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObligatory: \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7", "votes": 523, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9985, "date_posted": "2021-06-12 06:36:01", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 12:04:02", "reddit_post_id": "ny0g1b"}, "1224": {"post_id": 15518, "author_id": 560576, "post_title": "Dicks also fuck assholes \u00ad\u0192\u00dc\u00c7\u00ad\u0192\u00ec\u00e6", "self_text": "", "votes": 244, "post_title_sentiment": -0.8074, "self_text_sentiment": 0, "date_posted": "2021-06-12 04:07:20", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 12:05:44", "reddit_post_id": "nxy53x"}, "1225": {"post_id": 15519, "author_id": 620254, "post_title": "Why you should make a WISH", "self_text": "I just WISH to highlight some facts from my own analysis on why I think WISH is worth a look.

I personally have lost money in both the IPOs that I bought into and now avoid IPOs like the plague. However, I wanted to keep my personal experience out of the analysis and wanted to understand\n\n**Whether IPOs in general make or lose money for the average investor?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** iposcoop.com\n\nThis is the first time in any of the analyses that I have done where the data was accessible directly in a usable format. They have documented almost all of the IPOs from 2000. I have cross verified the data with [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/) and have observed coverage of more than 90%. This period covers a wide variety of situations such as the dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis, market rally following the crisis, etc. which implies that our analysis covers both bear and bull market.,\n\nAll the IPOs and my analysis have been shared on a Google sheet at the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cfa0ni07u471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc604e1016e7aa4550141751f9904567d7209daf\n\n**Analysis**\n\nBefore we jump into the analysis, there are some things we need to understand about IPOs (if you know the inner workings of an IPO, please feel free to skip to the results). When a company wants to go public, they hire investment bankers to sell the shares. The investment banks are then responsible for creating interest, choosing the optimum time to go public, and make sure the price is right so that there is enough demand. But the banks offer a large share of the allocated stock to institutional investors such as pensions, endowments, or hedge funds. Retail brokerages can end up getting shares, but they may make up only [10% of the total allotment](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price).\n\nAdding to this, additional factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not. (i.e., Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients). For e.g., in the case of [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.\n\nI have factored in the above limitations and have calculated the historical performance of the IPOs in two different ways\n\na.\u252c\u00e1You get the IPO allocated at the offer price (the price at which institutional investors are buying)\n\nb. You buy the IPO when the market opens on the listing day (opening price)\n\nFor the above scenarios, I have analyzed the following\n\n* Listing Change (Difference between Opening price and Offer price)\n* One day change - inclusive of listing\n* One day change - exclusive of listing\n\nTo make it simple, let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s take the example of company X. If the offer price of the IPO is $10, the Opening price on the day of the IPO is $12 and the Closing price is $15 then,\n\n* Listing change is +20%\n* One day change inclusive of the listing is +50%\n* One day change exclusive of the listing is +25%\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vby0prh27u471.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6276dde250412988455ba3d78d3b7e37418e24\n\nOn average, IPOs did make money for the investor. But the amount is significantly different if you got allocated the IPO at offer price vs you bought the IPO at market open. The average listing change over the last two decades was 12% and the average one-day gain in the market inclusive of the listing was 13.6%. Adding to this more than 68% of the IPOs ended in green on the listing day.\n\nBut the story is markedly different if you choose to buy at the market open. Only 48% of the IPOs ended at a price higher than the opening price and the average change was a mere 1.3%. Now that it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s out of the way, diving deeper into the data brings interesting insights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7f5sbp547u471.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=733dc5a1fb88e6c1d49490c2278c0e17d20913f3\n\nAbove is the list of top 10 IPOs having the most amount of gain on listing day. Baidu.com made a whopping 354% on its listing day. Another interesting observation is 6 out of 10 companies in the list were listed in 2000 and were predominantly tech companies (just before the dot com crash). But not all companies had a great experience on the IPO day. Here is a list of the worse performing companies on the day of listing. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/562w2az57u471.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfeeb4dcd44348538c657d3cfc0fb4a3920e6d59\n\nThere are certainly some familiar names on the list. [Funko IPO](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/funko-stock-plunges-in-ipo-shocker/) is considered to have the worst first-day return for an IPO in the last two decades. Sundial Growers also had a rough time in the market on its listing day with the stock losing 35% of the value in one day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c71zm1j77u471.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b5009abef9c0e0f90c4166767ef878824a730\n\nI also calculated the IPO returns for each year after 2000. As expected, the year 2000 was the most successful year for an IPO with an average return (inclusive of listing gain) of 35%. The worst year was 2008 (after the financial crisis) with only a 2.3% return. This graph also showcases two important things\n\na. On average the IPOs have made positive returns every year in the last two decades\n\nb. There is a vast difference in your returns based on if you got the stock at offer price vs opening price and the trend holds across the years.\n\nThis brings us to our final question of which investment bank made the most number of IPOs and how was their performance on listing day\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dxy9xq597u471.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4dbd6096edbb790669325b91cce48759b4f393)\n\nOut of the top 10 list, only 3 Investment banks had below-average returns. We are not going to draw any conclusion from this as an IPO is usually handled by multiple banks in partnership and the above analysis is done using Fuzzy match (its an approximate match)\n\n**Limitations of the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na.\u252c\u00e1\u252c\u00e1We don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t have 100% coverage for the IPOs done since 2000. From comparing to other sources, I could observe more than 90% coverage and I feel that this should be representative of the whole.\n\nb.\u252c\u00e1\u252c\u00e1There is no data showcasing what percentage of each IPO was offered to the retail investor.\n\n**Conclusion:** I have some theories to explain the IPO performance. I think it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s driven mainly by two factors. One being the hype/PR generated by the investment bank about the company and the second is that I think the investment banks slightly price the IPO lower than the market value of the company so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO). Both these factors contribute to the listing as well as the one-day gain that we see across the board.\n\nOverall, this once again seems to a situation where having money makes you more money (institutional investors having easier access to the IPO) but as the analysis shows retail investors can still make significant gains by buying into an IPO!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing all the data: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHsXW7-2bu0jafuZe_0LmapSE5V5KXYF14Oe0lG2TKA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

RISK <-four letters; not the word you were thinking of right?\n\nFundamentally, risk is a life philosophy and how we each measure the potential for reward vs penalty. (blah, blah, google stuff, theory on decision analysis, statistics and practical examples)\n\nHere's my simplified version:\n\n**RISK: Four Tenets for A Four Letter Word**\n\n1.  **Live another day**. (Lesson from wreck and cavern diving) Don't go in so deep you can't make it out when everything goes wrong. Same applies to depth and (lack of) diversity of investing plays. Someone asked in r/thetagang about what to do with 100 naked calls they sold that are now ITM. Others YOLO their tuition /rent /mortgage /savings /medicine money. Don't do this.\n\n [I\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6m dumb and feel so hopeless. Never SELL NAKED CALLS. My 100k loss turned into over 600K in minutes with AMC.

(aka Exit Strategy)** (military maxims) \"Failure to Plan is to plan to fail.\" \"A plan is a baseline for change.\" This is about figuring out ahead of time what your personal exit points are. There was a guy one weekend on WSB holding options up 3000% and wondering if he should sell some.\n\n3.  **Call it off when it's going wrong**. (diving, trail riding). This is not a life or death mission. If it's a bad day and things are going screwy, recognize it, and call it early, rather than late. Have a beer and talk about what might have been...Do not \"double down\". (Like I did when CLOV was being suppressed in May, but I was on hopium, so I bought more calls, and they all became worthless.)\n\n4.  **Recognize how little you know.** (every sport, hobby, and pastime) The world is full of excited, happy hobbyists! People who know a lot about subject are experts and usually do it for a living. Experts can recognize the limits of their own knowledge, unusual situations, and unashamedly seek counsel from trusted peers. Hubris is a common character flaw in Greek tragedy plays. Be aware of your own limitations; there's no Deus Ex Machinas out here! Seek advice before you get into trouble!\n\nThere a bunch more I could have added, but I know there's some awesome experience and brainpower lurking on various subs (and yes, even here) who can add what the average investing hobbyist should look for under one of these four headings.\n\nResources:\n\n [Options Strategies | Learn To Trade Options - The Options Playbook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/) \n\ninvestopedia, youtube\n\nRecognize that you WILL make mistakes, and that the market can move in mysterious ways.

Chances are that company was a biotech or a biopharma company. This sector is truly the wild west of the stock market, filled with low cap, low float, low volume, high short interest stocks that can make outsized moves like mooning 400% or drilling 90% a day based on catalysts like FDA approvals/rejections and trial results. \n\nNow you read what I said about moving out of your wife\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s boyfriend\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s shed and said \u00d4\u00c7\u00a3Chad is a fucking douche, he always drinks all my mountain dew and won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t let me stay up past 8 o\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6clock\u00d4\u00c7\u00d8 and you want out on a volatile biopharm rocket to Valhalla. Allow daddy u/Academic-Lake to introduce you to Blueprint Medicines Corporation (BPMC). \n\nBPMC is set to get FDA approval for a new drug called Ayvakit on June 16th, which is this Wednesday. Ayvakit will be used to treat Advanced Systemic mastocytosis (SM), which is a rare disease that can lead to organ damage and shorten life expectancies. Ayvakit is already approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but gaining approval for additional disease will broaden the scope of the drug significantly and increase sales. Analysts expect Ayvakit, if it is approved, to be a significant driver of the companies sales going forward. \n\nBut how is the company going to make money on rare diseases? Well, the Ayvakit treatment is very pricey. A 30 day supply of tablets costs around $35,000, and the total cost of a treatment can be up to $250,000. There is no generic version of the drug available, so BPMC can effectively monopolize the treatments for these rare diseases. \n\nBPMC became profitable this year and has a PE ratio of 14.9, compared to the industry average of 22.4. The analyst consensus for forecasted annual earnings growth is 56.6%, compared to the industry average of 14.7%. **The average analyst consensus PT is $117.92, while I saw one site estimate a fair value of $763.57 per share.** This is a significant upside from the current price of 86.90. This FDA approval in particular will be a significant step towards achieving these targets, and BPMC also has a promising development pipeline of other drugs which I won\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t cover for the sake of brevity. \n\nNow that we know about the catalyst that can fuel the next move up for BPMC, let\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s talk institutional ownership and volume. Institutions own 99.11% of the company, and they have been buying heavily throughout Q1 and Q2. BPMC has an average 3 month volume of 401,428, and volume today was above average at slightly over 600,000. Regardless, if the catalyst of the FDA approval on June 16th throws significant buying pressure behind this stock, we could see an eye watering spike during the session. There is also a significant amount of open interest on 6/18 95c, so if they become ITM the spike could further be supercharged by MM gamma hedging.\n\nSo how do we play this? Well, we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re not exactly buying bonds here, and we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6re a bunch of degenerates. In the spirit of this sub this is a true FD play. Options are surprisingly cheap on this stock, with 6/18 95c being 0.50c each as of market close Friday. If the stock spikes by just 15% on the FDA approval, the 6/18 95c will be TEN BAGGERS. And, as we\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6ve seen previously with some other biotech plays, these small cap biotechs can go significantly higher than just +15% on an FDA approval. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**BPMC is significantly undervalued due to a variety of metrics, and the upcoming FDA decision on June 16th can be a catalyst to return to previous highs and above.**\n\nThis should go without saying but I am not a financial advisor and this is for entertainment only and not financial advice. Biotech plays are usually boom or bust so do not gamble any money you cannot afford to lose. I would appreciate feedback, including reasonable bear cases.\n\nEdit: the SM treatment specifically will award the drug FDA break through status which means the company will get preferential treatment for patents and expedited review times.

It is a recent IPO, it went public in September 2020.\n\nIt is clear that there are funds interested in keeping it below 35, as there have been moments of 6% drop in the aftermarket with a ridiculous volume : less than 50,000.\n\nAlso on the other hand there is downward pressure: Eagletree Capital, as I understand, has to reduce its position in Corsair from the current 61% to 10% in less than 5 years, which is helping to keep the price flat.\n\nEdit: apparently this eagletree Capital was a fake new, so not confirmed. anyways they reduced position from 70% to 61%, so they are atleast taking some profit.\n\nLet's talk numbers:\n\nCorsair's latest report has shattered all expectations:\n\n\u252c\u00c0 EPS of 0.58 versus the 0.25 estimate.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 A gross margin of 30.3%.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Revenue increased 72%  YoY.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Adjusted ebitda was up 197% to 80.4M\n\n\u252c\u00c0 They reduced debt by 28M\n\n**Basically beat all 4 estimates.**\n\nAnd Corsair improved forecast from 1.8B to 2.1B. They tend to be quite cautious with their estimates, just look at how they have far outperformed analysts in past quarters.\n\nAnd now, let's get to the key point. I see a very repeated comment and that is the comparison between Corsair and Logitech or Dell.\n\nThey have nothing to do with each other.\n\nCorsair's strength is how well it utilizes its capital to obtain profitable ventures.\n\nThis is where the good stuff comes in.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Corsair owns elgato. That company that has a monopoly on capture, green screens, spotlights, streamdeck... and aggressively increasing their products to cameras, capture, mic stands, microphones... I don't know how high up you are in the streaming world, but elgato is literally in any setup. And if you see the exponential growth of Twitch, add 1 + 1. Not only for streamers, but also the work at home movement is driving the sale of their products.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Corsair has just acquired in February 2021 Visuals by impulse, a company dedicated to the creation of overlays and alerts, to further monopolize the stream environment.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Corsair owns Scuf gaming, a company dedicated to custom controllers for pc, xbox or play station.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Corsair owns Gamer Sensei, a platform that connects professionals or people skilled in video games with others who want to improve their level.\n\n\u252c\u00c0 Corsair owns origin pc, a platform for selling peripherals and pre-assembled computers.\n\n**The acquisition of Visuals by impulse, gamer sensei and scuf gaming occurred in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In other words, they have an insurmountable acquisition hunger.**\n\nAnd of course, Corsair, market leader in peripherals and components in various niche markets, the king of RGB, amazing towers, probably the best software and a HUB to control all your components.\n\nBasically it remains to expand into the mobile sector, but their intentions are quite clear, they are looking to be leaders in multiple sectors.\n\nWhen I was younger, about 10 years ago, if you liked video games you were basically the class geek, and your chances of being bullied increased dramatically.\n\nNow things have changed, the freak is basically the one who doesn't play. And watching streamings has become the new television for the new generations.\n\nOne of the arguments against corsair is that once the pandemic is over people will stop playing and do other things. You can tell they have never met a gamer. When a person starts, they don't stop. You don't buy a $2500 computer and trade it in for a $500 computer later. And a gamer, is always a gamer.\n\nIt is also very relevant the fact that there is still a lot of population without internet access and the video game sector is one of the most expanding sectors ahead, which is a tremendously bullish argument.\n\nAnd another plus point, this incredible surpassing of expectations has happened in an environment with chip problems, where people didn't have graphics cards (or they were extremely expensive), nor did they have PS5 to buy and stream with it, and Corsair itself has said that they focused on building only premium products with high margins to stay competent. This clearly says how much potential they have if they have overcome such a difficult time.\n\n**TL:DR:**\n\nI could give many empty arguments, talk about shorts, to the moon.... but that's not the point. We are talking about a temporarily manipulated high growth company trading at a FORWARD PER of almost 15. It is a simply ridiculous situation, and even more with the current valuations shown by the market.\n\n45-50$ is the fair value, but we can go even higher. \n\n**My positions**\n\n\u252c\u00c0 258 shares\n\n\u252c\u00c0 1/2022 35 call, 8/20 35 40, and 40 calls.", "votes": 42, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9898, "date_posted": "2021-06-12 14:35:30", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 12:07:20", "reddit_post_id": "ny84rr"}, "1247": {"post_id": 15541, "author_id": 551303, "post_title": "::RUMOR:: Keep an eye on $DISCA $T $MSFT; News started making rounds after market close that MSFT could be acquiring all/or parts of WB Interactive, announced tomorrow 6/12 at E3.", "self_text": "Keep an eye on $DISCA $T $MSFT rumors are circulating that Microsoft could announce an acquisition at E3 tomorrow of some of WB Interactives' valuable assets (right now Rocksteady and NetherRealm are the leading candidates).

This is a fact. (Refer to linked img)\n\nWrestlemania 38 is next year's biggest Pay Per View to take place in Texas, the home state of legend and icon, \"Stone Cold Steve Austin\".\n\nFor those who don't know who he is or follow wrestling, Austin was the most popular star in all of pro wrestling back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Rock and Stone Cold had the greatest feuds ever, and their WM matches were legendary and very exciting to watch. Arguably more popular than Hulk Hogan during his 80s and early 90s run, it's safe to say next year the stock of WWE will reach new highs.\n\nStone Cold will make some sort of return next year, but not as a wrestler since he has been retired since 2003.\n\nNext year will be a large show, since vaccination rates all across the U.S. should be over 70% but likely closer to 90%. This would mean MANY fans will be in attendance. The live shows for the weekly RAW, NXT and SD will bring in lots of money and the stock will clearly rebound.\n\nI also predict by next April, Becky Lynch will most likely return before or at WrestleMania 38. She already has a kid, and so I'm sure she would have found a babysitter for her girl by then. She made a lot of money during her rise to the top of the company since 2018, so she can easily afford one.\n\nI will be buying some January calls on Monday or Tuesday, assuming it's a red day again.

I think this is a very valid consideration and looking for input.  No way in hell I want to get caught in the short side of an APE army but I do believe in fundamentals of markets.  \n\nWith the pandemic ending soon I've been looking at some short options to trade.   Some of the biggest gainers like Peloton were amazing on the way up.  Demand was so hot you had to wait months to even get a bike.  Their subscription services were through the roof hot.  They had some major trouble a few months ago with shipping / cargo.  In-fact they are still having those issues.  So much so they decided to announce a US based manufacturing plant that will cost upwards of 500 million dollars and will not be completed until 2023.\n\nMajor inflationary pressures I believe that are not in current revenue numbers.  The cost of carbon fiber steel has increased in Aug 2020 from $459 to $1511 today.  A near 300% increase and still climbing quickly.   These pricing pressures to manufacture their equipment must hit their bottom line soon and thus I believe will impact earnings next quarter.\n\nNext take a look at shipping issues.  Pricing on shipping is still increasing.  If they can't deal with shipping issues until 2023, I believe we will see more pressure on the bottom line.\n\nThen, how many people do you know that are getting \"back out\" to the gym.  I was just at my local LifeTime fitness and it was SOLID packed.  Granted, I'm in Tx but I'm hearing that places are opening back up.  I believe while a lot of people will be scared for a while longer, that more people will cancel their Peloton subscriptions and want to get back into society and socialize at the gyms.  Also you'll find a large subscription churn if consumers are getting hit with inflation pressures on other goods/services which we are seeing.  They will cut expenses where they can and subscriptions like Peloton would go before Netflix and chill...\n\nLastly lets look at the major shareholders of the company.  This is primarily composed of mutual fund companies.  Vanguard Group invested a hella lot back in April-July 2020.  They went from 3 million shares to today 22 million shares.  I believe with the re-opening trade and headwinds described above these mutual fund companies are severely overweight and will rebalance very very soon if pricing continues to decline.\n\nI'm noticing some pressures around Options trading.  Their appears to be a market maker who is selling quite a bit of puts and then like today on low volume increasing pricing with no underlying news, on a down dow day.... Sus for sure...\n\nWith the above, I believe that some of the Covid plays should be considered for the short side trade.\n\nThoughts?", "votes": 6, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": -0.699, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 18:11:01", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 12:07:52", "reddit_post_id": "nxmegg"}, "1261": {"post_id": 15555, "author_id": 620371, "post_title": "SPWR - $100 by end of August $200 long term", "self_text": "I think it would be a really good idea to buy and hold SPWR. $100 short term, and super strength long term.

With 5G and everything running off of fiber, Is this a good stock to invest in and why?\n\nThe global spread of Coronavirus has impacted the sales of Corning due to a decline in capital spending from some of its customers as well as pricing pressure for its display glass products. That said, the company is now seeing a rebound in demand, and it posted a 2% y-o-y sales growth in Q3. The company\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s total revenue in the first three quarters of 2020 was down 8.4% y-o-y to $8.0 billion, while the adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share reflect a 77% decline over the $1.10 figure reported in the prior year period, primarily led by higher operating costs owing to the pandemic. Looking forward, with economies opening up gradually and availability of vaccines, the capital spending on 5G is expected to rise, boding well for Corning\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s optical fiber business, while the company will also see higher sales of its glass vials that are being used for Covid-19 vaccines. Also, the new Apple iPhone 12 uses ceramic shield, manufactured by Corning, and iPhone 12 sales alone are touted to be in the range of 80 to 100 million units by October 2021, again boding well for Corning. That said, much of these factors appear to be priced in the current stock value of $36, despite the expected recovery in demand post Covid. In reality, 2020 full year revenues are estimated to see a decline of 3% to $11.3 billion, while earnings are expected to be down 22% to $1.37.", "votes": 0, "post_title_sentiment": 0.5768, "self_text_sentiment": 0.8869, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 18:51:25", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 12:08:09", "reddit_post_id": "nxnb47"}, "1278": {"post_id": 15572, "author_id": 75962, "post_title": "$NCLH - DD on COVID cases on RCL", "self_text": "Hey retards, as stated on my previous post, I have been heavily invested on NCLH for a while, investing roughly $80k on Jan 2022 calls.\n\nAlthough I have taken a bit of profits, I have roughly $60k still running on this option calls. Here is why I think there might still be upside potential and, at the same time buying opportunity ahead of us. This is not financial advice.\n\n- First off, it\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6s important to flag that the market cap of NCLH hasn\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t recovered to pre-pandemic levels while other cruise lines have. If you add inflation to it plus increased demand, there is an argument that there is a 10 to 20% upside left. PT for some analysts on the street is around $38 to $40 a share.\n\n- As the news broke out today, there were 2 COVID cases on one of the 95% vaccinated RCL cruise. This will cause some short term panic but, if the cases remain only at 2, this is great news! Why? Remember, the most effective vaccine currently has a 95% efficacy which means that, in a crew+passengers of 2000 people, we expect at least 100 people to be potentially contaminated (5% of 2000). So anything less than a 100 cases is actually better odds than you just going to a bar or restaurant on your own.\n\n- NCLH is also the best prepared for these scenarios, as they are pushing for fully vaccinated crews/passenger while other cruise companies are doing a hybrid approach (i.e. you pay more if you are not vaccinated). Right now, a few cases in a cruise ship are inevitable but an outbreak will bring the industry to a halt. So NCLH has the better odds on not having an outbreak.\n\nWith all of those points, there is also some risks ahead of the industry:\n\n- Political issues in case the company cant require vaccination certifications: In those cases, outbreaks will be inevitable, which will cause hesitancy on new passengers and potentially reduced US sailings. In this case, I will sell my options as I think the risk is too big.\n\n- Current cases become an outbreak of 100s of people. Same as before, could cause hesitancy and problem in the industry overall.\n\n- Vaccines don\u00d4\u00c7\u00d6t work: then the whole stock market will crash.\n\nOnce again, thread carefully and take profits when you can. Use short term panic as buying opportunities.\n\nMy positions: 234 $40 calls expiring in Jan 2022", "votes": 0, "post_title_sentiment": 0, "self_text_sentiment": 0.9484, "date_posted": "2021-06-11 15:49:46", "date_pulled": "2021-06-12 12:08:11", "reddit_post_id": "nxj51i"}, "1279": {"post_id": 15573, "author_id": 620399, "post_title": "Freaking $100K YOLO on INVZ!

It all hit relatively at the same time between Feb 2020 - March 2020, when the pandemic spiked.\n\nSome airlines especially larger economies such as Canada and US airlines stocks are recovering. In order, Air Canada @ Peak 47$ dropped to $12.41 and is currently @ 27. Delta (one of many US airlines) @ Peak ~60$ dropped to 22$ and is now @ 48$.\n\nSimilarly, Qantas (Australia) @ peak 6.50$ dropped to 2.36$ and is now 4.71$ (it was closer to 8$ @ peak but it dropped a bit before it fell off completely at the timestamps, so keeping things specific to the pandemic)\n\nFinally, Air NZ @ peak $3.00, dropped to 80 \u252c\u00f3 and is back up to $1.63. Now I don't expect insane % increases the likes of what we see in e-commerce, and that of the diamond handed folk of WSB, but as the economy begins to recover over the next few years and Air travel for tourism and goods will return, expect the stock to return to normal (or increase as tourism will increase as borders re-open)\n\nI have more DD from ministry of health vaccine roll-out plans (publicly available and being a health student am now able to receive my vaccine) that lets me know that the current turnaround to have everyone vaccinated with relation to achieving herd immunity, and previous vaccine data of other diseases let's me know that it will be a few years before a solid rebound occurs.\n\nDD of publicly available GDP sources of our economy in the form of tourism and recognizing over-stock of perishables in wholesale, etc. That I can explain in another post.\n\nDD of previous cases namely Oil and gas, traumatic events and a variety of others that plummeted stock prices that have recovered to-date.\n\nNow I am not one to say it is good to be making money knowing it is because of the cost of lives lost that resulted in it. But I don't expect to be using this money on myself, you all have shown me what good can come from your donations, and I plan to do the same, or at least take care of my family.\n\nP.S, not a financial advisor, the whole 9 yards, you know the drill.

Trending down today by about 5% and wondering about buying the dip. Wanted to get some opinions. \n\nI know things are starting to stabilize with people returning to the new normal, but telemedicine appears to be continuing to tend up regardless. \n\nI've seen the UI and how turnkey Hims and Hers is setup. For those new to the company, they are a startup, but they are definitely a disruptor to the healthcare industry. 24/7, quick access to doctors and medical pros, pharmacy is turnkey, pricing is relatively simple and automated. Also OTC health products part of the model, which is definitely a differentiator. \n\nFor those attracted to the title of this thread, one of their big draws is erectile dysfunction. And yes, probably less banging at home as pandemic restrictions lift, but the sexual second coming is literally coming! Outside of this though, they do have plans for treating diabetes and patients with high cholesterol. \n\nSome figures I found about their actual results:\n\nQ1-2021 - 687,000 orders - growth of 25.8% in the past year. Revenue increased 75% to $53 million.\n\nWhat do you think apes? I'm looking to buy the dip and ride this one like I'm hoping to be ridden after taking some of the Hims products that come to my door.\n\nP.s. I may have low karma as I am a newb here, but I'm no damn bot.
